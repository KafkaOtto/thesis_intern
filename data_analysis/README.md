# All the necessary python files to generate plots for report and presentation

This is the description of the files in the `data_analysis` directory:
- `normality_checking.py`: Contains functions to assess whether a dataset follows a normal distribution, typically using statistical tests and visualizations.
- `t_test.py`: Perform t-test, holm bonferroni correction, cohens_d scores. Plot the histogram of significant results, and percentage changes.
- `energy_device_percentage.py`: Calculates and analyzes the percentage of total energy consumption attributed to GPU.
- `energy_processes_percentage.py`: Computes the proportion of energy usage by different processes, helping to identify major energy consumers in the system.
- `t_test_comparison_combo.py`: Generate Metric-Wise Percentage Changes for Best Combo Compared to Baseline.
- `t_test_comparison_rqs.py`: Generate Metric-Wise Percentage Changes for Each Technique Compared to Baseline.
