[Sigrid](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/solutions/sigrid-software-assurance-platform/) helps you to improve your software by measuring your system\'s code quality, and then compares the results against a benchmark of 10,000 industry systems to give you concrete advice on areas where you can improve.

<img src="images/overall-portfolio-dashboard.png" width="700" />

Sigrid performs code quality checks that have been designed by the [Software Improvement Group](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/), which have been used by thousands of development teams over the past 20 years to help improve their software. SIG\'s approach is based on the [ISO 25010 standard for software quality](https://www.iso.org/standard/35733.html), and has been accredited to ensure alignment with the standard.

## About this documentation

This documentation acts as a user guide for Sigrid. This covers:

- **Context and background:** This page dedicates some words to our vision developing and offering Sigrid. A high-level overview of its goals and functionality.
- [Roles and usage](getting-started/roles.md): The main roles/typical users that Sigrid supports. These range from management and (enterprise) architects to product owners and developers. Different roles typically have different needs for views/detail, roughly from portfolio/trend to code detail view.
- **Analysis scenarios:** We discuss typical analysis needs or use cases and the steps can you take to get there.

## Sigrid, why you need it

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7xvcN9S5zY8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Sigrid is a fact-supported cost-saver, risk-management aid and a technical-debt prioritization tool that can be used to improve quality at all system levels.

It does that by providing you the data to steer business decisions and make technical improvements.

## Sigrid, how we see it

We know that most organizations rely on software to run their business. Software, and taking control of it, is therefore at the center of business decisions.

- To make confident business decisions in this context, you need to be confident about the internals (the health) of your software landscape. We will provide you with the data to get that insight, and make informed decisions. The type of data accommodates the organizational context. Therefore, functionality focuses on:
  - Seeing trends of the portfolio of software as a whole.
  - Bringing together many types of technical health (such as maintainability, security, architecture).
  - Offering transparency on IT quality, which evokes accountability and makes code contributors proud of their work.

## What can you use Sigrid for?

As SIG’s software quality assurance platform, Sigrid provides a *single source of truth* of software health. This helps you steer decision-making while you buy, build, maintain and modernize your software. We call this ‘bit to boardroom insights’. These decisions will range from high-level system lifecycle decisions (e.g., renewal, decommissioning) to code-level recommendations (e.g., what to refactor and upgrade) to improve and smoothen out patterns that may slow down or endanger your business.

Sigrid visualizes your software landscape according to various technical quality aspects, INTO rag.a single solution. *Quality* here is understood as characteristics of technical health (or technical debt). This includes terms defined and understood in the ISO 25010 standard, such as maintainability and security. Bringing these aspects together broadens your overview of your software landscape, which helps you expose possible technical risks.

<img src="images/objectives-overview.png" width="600" />

The screenshot above shows an example on how Sigrid can help you to define and track objectives for various quality aspects. You can do this for every system in your portfolio. For more context on the relation between systems and their repositories, see [systems](organization-integration/systems.md).

## How does Sigrid work?

Essentially, Sigrid’s insights are based on source code analysis. Analyses are run on the code "as is", so without actually running the system. This is known as *static analysis*, as opposed to *dynamic analysis*. Dynamic analysis of software is more typically done by the developers themselves, because it requires a simulation of how a system will behave in operation.

Sigrid recognizes, calculates and prioritizes code characteristics that indicate software health. Such as whether the code contains design anti-patterns (undesirable constructs), whether the code contains security flaws (or imported, external code contains those).

Sigrid communicates results as benchmarked star ratings. You can find more information about [our approach](getting-started/approach.md) later in this documentation.

High quality application development requires software architecture. On paper, it describes your technical choices, constraints, and is a reflection of business decisions. But the architecture may look very different once it is implemented in code. Objectively, badly implemented architecture is easy to see (like incoherence). To assess what is well-implemented architecture, we have to look broader.

Software architecture can seem abstract, but it is ultimately how the structure of your software facilitates the people working on it. The code will not care that it is highly coupled, but the people working on that code certainly do care about having dependencies on other people and teams. Sigrid can help you to both *communicate* the as-is architecture as it is actually implemented, and also help to find opportunities on how it can be improved.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K5BbtWxFJYk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## A wide measure of Architecture Quality

When people talk about "legacy" or "monoliths", they often mean much more than just outdated technology. What people usually mean is software that has become too fragile for changes to be timely, predictable, and reliable. Usually due to poor architecture or team knowledge loss. An architecture should be able to adapt to those changing circumstances. Therefore, we define *architecture quality* as the degree to which an architecture is flexible and adaptable to change.

So to make an assessment of architectural/future flexibility, we measure widely. Next to measuring the technical fundamentals, we also look at (code) evolution over time. For example the spread of code contributions over developers. We then compare your results against [SIG\'s benchmark](../getting-started/approach.md) to clarify what is going well and where improvement is needed.

## Navigating to Architecture Quality

If Architecture Quality is available for your system, you can reach this view via the top menu, or by clicking an a capability on the System or Portfolio *Overview* pages. See the [system-level Overview page](system-overview.md#navigating-to-capabilities) or [portfolio-level Overview page](portfolio-overview.md#navigating-to-capabilities).

## Architecture Quality overview

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/00EqRufzg5w?si=G6Jx4zrkiovHtknp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The overview page provides a summary of your system\'s current architecture, relative to the other systems in SIG\'s benchmark. The structure of this page is comparable to Sigrid\'s [maintainability summary](system-maintainability.md): you have an overall rating, which is then split INTO rag.a number of underlying system properties and associated ratings. Hovering your cursor over the system properties on the right provides you with a short description of each metric. For more information on SIG\'s Architecture Quality Model, please consult the [Guidance for Producers](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/Guidance-for-producers-Architecture-Quality-Model.pdf).

<img src="../images/aq-summary.png" width="600" />

This page provides you with a summary, but you may decide that further investigation INTO rag.your system\'s current architecture is needed. You can use the "explore architecture" button to navigate to Sigrid\'s architecture explorer page. Clicking on one of the system properties on the right will *also* take you to the architecture explorer page, but will then immediately jump to the system property you just clicked on.

## Exploring your system\'s as-is architecture

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BejJ9sHeUOQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The architecture explorer page visualizes your architecture. Not the architecture that was initially planned, not the to-be architecture, but the implemented as-is architecture. The information used to provide this view is extracted from your source code, your repository history, and your configuration.

<img src="../images/aq-explorer.png" width="600" />

In this visualization, every "block" is a *system element* in your code. Depending on the terminology you use, this could be called a subsystem or a component. Arrows between the system elements indicate *dependencies*. Depending on your system, the view might show different types of dependencies in different colors:

- Code dependencies, for example Java calls.
- Interface dependencies, for example a REST API that is provided by one component and used by another component.
- Database dependencies, for example SQL queries.
- Hidden dependencies, for example duplication between two components.

You can use the "show legend" button in the top left to get more information on what each element in the visualization means.

Each system element also includes a magnifying glass icon. Clicking this icon will "expand" the system element, which allows you to see its internal architecture. In many cases this low-level architecture is more actionable, as this is usually the responsibility of the team working on that system element. In other words: you need many people to discuss changes to your top-level architecture, but you can usually address issues in your internal architecture with your own team.

<img src="../images/aq-drilldown.png" width="500" />

The different tabs across the top of the page represent the system properties in SIG\'s Architecture Quality Model. Selecting a different tab will also change the architecture view, to provide more specific information relevant to that system property. It will also change the detail panel on the right, to expose more detailed charts and data relevant to the selected system property.

<img src="../images/aq-metric-details.png" width="500" />

Clicking on a dependency will provide you with a list of where those dependencies originate in your code. If a dependency is connected to a file, clicking on that file will navigate you to Sigrid\'s code explorer page where you can inspect the file and its source code in more detail.

<img src="../images/aq-dependencies.png" width="500" />

If your architecture contains a large number of components, it can be tricky to quickly identify a certain component in the architecture visualization. You can use the "folder" icon in the top left of the page to open the tree view. This provides you with a secondary way of navigating your architecture. Using the tree view is quicker in some scenarios, for example if you want to quickly check what files are located within a certain component. The tree view and the main architecture visualization are linked, so selecting a subcomponent in the tree view will also navigate to that same subcomponent in the architecture visualization.

<img src="../images/aq-tree.png" width="250" />

The tree view also includes a search option. You can use this to locate a specific system element within your architecture, such as a component, file, end point, or database. This is also linked to the main architecture visualization, so clicking on the search results will also navigate the main architecture visualization to that same system element.

<img src="../images/aq-search.png" width="250" />

Finally, the buttons around the page allow you to manipulate the architecture view:

<img src="../images/aq-display-options.png" width="400" />

- The settings icon allows you to customize what is displayed, as depicted above.
- The "reset layout" button resets the architecture visualization to its original state, which can help to restore readability.
- The zoom buttons are an alternative way to zoom the architecture visualization, in addition to using your trackpad or mouse wheel to zoom.

### Pinning and hiding architecture components

As most software systems are comprised of many parts, each with differing levels of dependencies between them, it can often be overwhelming to view the architecture in its entirety. In fact, it\'s often the case that risk is localized across only a subset of the overall architecture while the majority of the remaining system elements can be safely ignored. As such, you will often want to target a specific set of components that have relations between each other while removing other components from view to more easily identify and triage these riskful hotspots without having to navigate through a mess of component and dependencies that are "muddying the waters" of your analysis.

Sigrid assists with this localized traige by allowing you to hide components (and their related dependencies) as needed. Alternatively, you can also "pin" components within the visualization to ensure they remain in view whenever you\'re navigating the architecture. Using these controls together allows you to keep systems elements that have your interest in sight, while hiding away those that are not relevant.

Hiding and/or pinning of components can be done in multiple ways:

1. When hovering over a component in the architecture canvas, two togglable icons will appear in the bottom left of the component\'s box:
- A Pin icon which ensures the component remains in view regardles of other actions in the canvas.
- A Hide icon to force the component out of view until it is reshown.

<img src="../images/aq-component-pin-hide.png" width="250" />

2. Component\'s can also be pinned and hidden (or unpinned and unhidden) from the tree view. Hovering over a component name within the tree view will also cause the pin and hide toggles to appear to the right of the name.

<img src="../images/aq-tree-view-pin-hide.png" width="250" />

Once the pin or hide icon has been toggled, these icons will remain visible in both the canvas and tree view to help easily identify which components have had their visibility modified and toggle this off as needed by clicking the shown icon again.

<img src="../images/aq-pin-hide-full.png" width="500" />

### Highlighting undesirable dependencies

You might have noticed that some dependencies are shown in red. These dependencies are considered undesirable, either because they violate a known architectural anti-pattern (for example cyclic dependencies), or because they have been marked as undesirable in [your configuration](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#architecture-quality).

<img src="../images/architecture-undesirable-dependency.png" width="350" />

### Grouping and annotating components

In some cases, you might want to communicate additional information through Sigrid\'s architecture view. Such information does not directly originate from the source code, but adds some context that makes the architecture easier to find and interpret.

You can define *groups* and *annotations* in [your configuration](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#architecture-quality). This information will then be depicted as an overlay on top of the architecture visualization in Sigrid.

<img src="../images/architecture-grouping.png" width="300" />

### Saving architectural views

It is possible for users to create and save specific views from the architecture explorer for later review or documentation purposes. When creating a new view, all elements currently displayed on within the explorer view are saved in their current state, at their current level within the architecture.

This means that any components that have been expanded, hidden or pinned will be stored "as displayed" and will be able to be retrieved and re-rendered from the Saved Views panel. Having the ability to save specific configurations of the canvas will allow teams to quickly access the dependencies between components or sub-components of highest interest and share these views across team members to get a more consistent perspective of your system\'s architecture at any level you deem important.

Accessing saved views is easily done through the architecture explorer, where we\'ve introduced a simple button that toggles a new panel to appear with an inventory of any saved views that exist for a given system.

<img src="../images/aq-saved-views-button.png" width="500" />

In order to create a new saved view, you must first open the "Open Saved Views Panel" button on the right side of the canvas explorer, which expands the Saved Views Panel over the existing Details Panel. From here, users can select from one of the existing saved views to render within the explorer canvas, or click the "Save current view" button at the top to save the current architecture configuration rendered in the explorer.

<img src="../images/aq-saved-views-panel.png" width="300" />

When clicking on the "Save current view" button, you will be prompted to give a name to the configuration currently displayed in the architecture canvas, so picking a descriptive name other than the default is highly recommended.

<img src="../images/aq-view-creation.png" width="300" />

Upon saving, a new entry will be added to the Saved Views list with the specified name, date and time of the views creation. This newly created architectureal view along with any additional pre-existing views are accessible to all users that are authorized to access this system.

<img src="../images/aq-updated-saved-views.png" width="300" />

#### Important things to note about saved views:
- A maximum of 10 Views are able to be saved per system
- Saved Views are tied to the system, not the user - any user with access to the system can select and render any saved view existing for a given system.

================================================

This FAQ specifically covers Sigrid\'s Architecture Quality functionality. Also check the [Sigrid FAQ](faq.md) for more information about Sigrid in general.

### How do I enable Architecture Quality for my project?

Architecture Quality is available by default. Once you\'ve published your system, you will automatically see an "Architecture" tab appear when you view your system in Sigrid.

You can us the [scope documentation](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md) to customize the Architecture Quality analysis for this system, if necessary.

### How do I enable the change history analysis?

This will happen automatically, assuming that you enabled Architecture Quality in the scope file and the change history is available.

### Which version control systems does SIG support for analyzing the change history?

Git, which has over 95 percent market share. Supporting other version control systems would require an unreasonable
amount of effort for the SIG infrastructure. However, clients can convert their repository to Git during their
pipeline. Examples:

  - [Subversion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/perform-migration-from-svn-to-git?view=azure-devops)
  - [Mercurial](https://markheath.net/post/how-to-convert-mercurial-repository-to)
  - [Microsoft TFS](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs)

### Does Architecture Quality support self-service configuration?

Yes, and the options are explained in the [scope documentation](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md).

### Do we support change history analysis for multi-repo systems?

Yes. If you use [multi-repo systems](../organization-integration/systems.md), each repository\'s change history will be used, and the results will be combined INTO rag.the overall system.

### Are Git submodules supported?

Yes. This does require you to initialize the submodules as part of your build pipeline, but this is done automatically by basically all mainstream development platforms. If you are manually cloning your repository in your pipeline, use `git clone --recurse-submodules` to clone both the "main" repository as well as its submodules.

### How does the change history analysis process merge commits versus squashing commits?

Teams working with Git will often use slightly different workflows:
[merge commits or squashing commits](https://blog.mergify.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-merge-commit-a-squash/).
We support both as part of our analysis. When using merge commits, we only count the "original commit" and not the
merge commit itself, to avoid counting every change twice. When squashing commits, we analyze the squashed commit
instead of the original commits, for the practical reason that we no longer have access to the original commits after
they have been squashed.

### Do we support shallow clones?

No, as the shallow clone will only download the code and will *not* download the change history.

### Can I exclude my repository from the upload to Sigrid altogether?

Yes. Sigrid CI generates a log file called `git.log`, and you can exclude this file from being uploaded. You can use the `--exclude` [option in Sigrid CI](../reference/client-script-usage.md), for example `--exclude git.log`.

### Troubleshooting issues when manually publishing your repository history

When you use Sigrid CI, your repository history is automatically anonymized and published to Sigrid. But it\'s also possible to *manually* export your repository history and publish it to Sigrid, as explained [here](../organization-integration/upload-instructions.md#creating-a-zip-file-for-your-system). If you run INTO rag.a situation where you believe you correctly published your repository to Sigrid, yet you\'re not seeing the results in Sigrid, you can use the steps below to assist you in troubleshooting the issue:

- Make sure you are pushing a `git.log` file to Sigrid. This file contains your repository history, and should be located in the same directory as the source code for that repository.
- Open the file and count the commits. Every commit uses a `@@@` prefix to make this easier to count. If you are only exporting a single commit, you might have accidentally published a [shallow clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone). A shallow clone does not include the Git history.
- Open the file and make sure it uses the UTF-8 character encoding.
- Check the dates for each commit, which you can check in the lines with the `@@@` prefix. By default, Sigrid will only analyze commits from the last year, so any commits older than that will be ignored. You can change [the history period used by Sigrid in the configuration](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#analyzing-your-repository-history), in case you want to use a longer period.

===========================================

This FAQ specifically covers Sigrid\'s security functionality. Also check the [Sigrid FAQ](faq.md) for more information about Sigrid in general.

## Security findings (ex. Open Source Health)

### Is it possible that Sigrid creates new findings without us changing the code?

Yes, in some cases. We are continuously extending our security knowledge base. Therefore, new findings are sometimes discovered in existing code. It might seem as a deterioration of the system\'s security. But actually it is a more accurate assessment of *security risk* in the system.

### What statuses can security findings have?
See [Different statuses of security findings](system-security.md#different-statuses-of-security-findings).

### How does the automatic detection of "Fixed" findings work?
The status of a finding is automatically updated based on its "fingerprint". If a fingerprint is no longer found, the issue will be set to *Fixed*. If a new fingerprint is found, it will become a new finding.

The finding fingerprint is a calculated identifier based on multiple characteristics of the finding: analysis tool, rule, file name, and the line of code where the finding was located combined with the line before and after it.

We use this approach to reduce the amount of busywork. Findings are automatically resolved to avoid situations where people fix something in the code, but then forget to update the finding in Sigrid. Moreover, multiple overlapping findings will automatically be merged if they have the same fingerprint. This means automatic deduplication, which is important for keeping the findings as actionable as possible.

### What are the risk thresholds for determining whether a risk is low-medium-high?
Findings are mapped on a scale from 0-10 based on a *CWE-CVSS* benchmark comparison. See the [explanation on CVSS in the security page](system-security.md#context-and-meaning-of-cvss-security-metrics-from-asset-to-risk) and [its different levels in Sigrid](system-security.md#cvss-scores-in-sigrid).

## Open Source Health

### Does Sigrid support transitive dependencies?
Yes. This is configurable. Scanning transitive dependencies is preferable from a security perspective, as vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies may be equally problematic as vulnerabilities in direct dependencies. However, it does introduce nuances: transitive dependencies might not actually be callable because they are somehow inactive. As a steering mechanism it may seem unfair to some teams, since the transitive dependencies are not within their direct control.

Therefore, scanning transitive dependencies can be enabled or disabled in [the analysis configuration](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#open-source-health).

### Why does the finding list count certain findings twice?

The findings list indicates *compliance*. Sometimes a single finding on a vulnerable library has multiple vulnerabilities in multiple categories (e.g. injection and XXE). In that case these are counted separately in the list. However, despite the finding appearing in multiple categories, it is still the same finding. It only counts as a single finding towards the total, and resolving the finding will resolve it towards all categories.

### What technology is Open Source Health based on?

Open Source Health is proprietary SIG technology where we combine 20+ different ecosystems. Examples are *Sonatype OSS Index*, *NVD*, *Google OSV*, and the *GitHub Security Advisory API*. Depending on the technology, this will analyze dependency management files (e.g. `pom.xml` or `package.json`), library source files (e.g. `jquery-3.6.1.js`), and binary library files (e.g. `log4j.jar`).

Open Source Health offers the option to create an SBOM (Software Bill Of Materials) report, either through the Sigrid user interface or [through the Sigrid API](../integrations/sigrid-api-documentation.md#vulnerable-libraries-in-open-source-health).

### Does SIG filter when resolving our system\'s dependencies?

SIG can filter dependency checks for internal dependencies to avoid exposing internal names, but they must be configured manually by SIG. [See the Open Source Health paragraph in our scope configuration document](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#open-source-health). Please inform SIG of such dependencies and their name conventions before onboarding.

### Why are some Open Source vulnerabilities missing a CVE?

SIG gathers data from multiple ecosystems. Most of these ecosystems link library vulnerabilities to CVEs, but some provide their own data that is not connected to CVEs.

### What are the risk thresholds that determine low-medium-high risk?

They are shown as a mouseover on the Open Source Health page in the top tile that summarizes risks. See the [open-source health page](system-open-source-health.md#navigating-the-overview-page).

### I previously marked a security finding in an open source library as a false positive, but now it is back?

Open Source Health produces security findings for the version of the open source library you are currently using. If you update the version, but that new version still contains the same issue, the finding will automatically be reopened. If you update the open source library to a version that no longer contains the issue, the security finding in Sigrid will automatically be marked as *"Fixed"*.


### We have a lot of (new) security findings. What should we do first?
Please see [elaboration on such strategies in the system-level security page](system-security.md#a-general-typical-strategy-for-processing-security-findings), or [specifically the paragraph on filtering security findings](system-security.md#filtering-results-for-false-positives-starting-with-open-source-vulnerabilities).

### To what extent does SIG provide consultancy for security findings?

This depends on your agreement with SIG, which can differ per system:

- **Fully automated findings:** You will always receive frequent new findings from the scan tools built INTO rag.Sigrid. Much expertise of SIG is constantly going INTO rag.the selection and configuration of these tools and the rules they apply. This includes the smart software that provides as much useful information about the finding, including links to various resources with more information.
- **Manual refinement:** This service provides interpretation, selection and enrichment of  tool findings by SIG experts. SIG experts remove false positives as much as possible. Where necessary, risk levels are changed. In addition, the SIG experts add remarks to the findings, with interpretation details and when relevant some mediation advice.
  - How far does SIG advisory go when it comes to findings refinement?
    - We offer first tier security coaching for findings. This means we do the most what we can from our side through the finding remarks. In addition, clients can ask questions in scheduled workshop moments or through e-mail.
    - The model is that training of personnel and second tier hands-on security coaching is to be organised by the client. When required, SIG can assist.
    - In case you believe that remarks can be more helpful: please  provide examples of where you believe this is the case. We want to offer useful guidance as well as we can.
- **Manual code review:** This service provides reviewing design, configuration and code for findings that cannot be detected by scan tools - typically involving the interpretation of logic, in context. The results are added INTO rag.the Sigrid finding workflow.

### What about security risk assessment and threat modeling?

These should indeed be considered requisites for dealing with security findings effectively. Please see our elaboration [on the system security page](system-security.md#threat-modeling-as-a-requisite-for-interpreting-security-findings).

==================================

<sig-toc></sig-toc>

### Sigrid Security

See [Sigrid Security: Frequently Asked Questions](faq-security.md).

### Sigrid Architecture Quality

See [Sigrid Architecture Quality: Frequently Asked Questions](faq-architecture.md).

## Usage questions

### Do you support pull request integration?

Yes! There are basically two usage scenarios for Sigrid CI, and you would typically use them both.

The first Sigrid CI use case is to *publish* your project\'s source code to Sigrid, which makes the analysis results accessible on [https://sigrid-says.com](https://sigrid-says.com). You would typically use this for your project\'s main branch, which can be `main`, `master`, or something project-specific. This is known as the *baseline version*.

The second use case is to use Sigrid CI for feedback during code reviews on pull requests. This wil compare the contents of the pull request agains the baseline version, allowing you to identify improvement areas in the new and changed code.

The [platform-specific documentation and examples](../README.md) cover instructions for both scenarios. We generally recommend to use Sigrid CI for both scenarios, although it\'s also perfectly fine to use Sigrid CI for one scenario but not the other.

### Does Sigrid CI fit in my workflow?

Different development teams use different workflows. Our [workflow documentation](../sigridci-integration/development-workflows.md) covers different development/branch/CI workflows, and how Sigrid CI would fit INTO rag.those workflows.

### Which technologies do you support?

Sigrid supports almost 300 different technologies, so we are pretty confident that we are able to support most projects out-of-the-box. Moreover, we are constantly adding support for new technologies, and extending our support for existing ones. This even includes some pretty specific technologies with a focused group of target users, such as proprietary programming languages developed in-house at our clients.

If you are using a technology that you believe we do not support, please contact us using the contact information below, and we\'ll see what we can do.

### What is my system name?

You will find the system name in the url of the monitor in Sigrid. The structure is https://sigrid-says.com/customer/systemname/-/maintainability

### How to get a token and account?

Follow the instructions on how to create your personal token [here](../organization-integration/authentication-tokens.md)

### What target quality should we use?

Avoid setting an unreasonably high target quality level. While it seems appealing to be ambitious, this can be demotivating or frustrating to people, as it\'s not always possible to achieve such a high level in every single change.

For systems implemented in modern technologies, we recommend a target quality level of 3.5 stars. This strikes a balance between ambition and practicality. Note that 3.5 is already above the benchmark average of 3.0 stars, so this level is already asking developers to outperform the industry as a whole, and is therefore quite a high target.

For legacy systems, the target quality should be in line with the system\'s current quality. If the system as a whole is currently at 2.1 stars, it\'s not realistic to ask every single code change to rate 4.0 stars or higher. The same applies to systems in domains where the technology makes it harder to write maintainable code, for example when using low-level languages like C.

### Where can I find more information about your metrics?

Sigrid itself includes a brief explanation of all metrics in the "refactoring candidates" page. If you need more information, you can find the [Guidance for producers](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/SIG-TUViT-Evaluation-Criteria-Trusted-Product-Maintainability-Guidance-for-producers.pdf) on our website, which provides more details on what is measured and why.

For training purposes, SIG also published a book on [building maintainable software](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Maintainable-Software-Java-Future-Proof/dp/1491953527/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&qid=1610456817&refinements=p_27%3AJoost+Visser&s=books&sr=1-7&text=Joost+Visser), which contains detailed explanations on the metrics. It is not necessary to read the book to use Sigrid, but having training material available can be useful when training new or junior developers.

### How can I use Sigrid to improve my code maintainability?
To improve a system\'s maintainability you will need to understand some context of [our approach to maintainability](../getting-started/approach.md), and e.g. the [paragraph with an overview on interpreting metrics](../getting-started/approach.md#further-reading-and-interpreting-metrics). Understanding on the used metrics is required [see the SIG quality model page](../reference/sig-quality-models.md). Because you will have a better idea of what the metrics are measuring conceptually, how it will help your maintenance, and what you should pay attention to. [The system maintainability page](system-maintainability.md) offers you an overview for navigating and understanding maintainability in Sigrid.

Depending on how you are using Sigrid (CI-integrated or web interface), you will see different levels of detail and follow a different order of activities (e.g. see the workflows:[general Agile process](../workflows/agile-development-process.md), [Architect](../workflows/architect.md), [Developer](../workflows/developer.md), [Product Owner](../workflows/product-owner.md) or [(Development) Manager](../workflows/manager.md)).

### What is the maximum upload size for Sigrid CI?

Sigrid CI is limited to uploads of 500 MB. This is mainly for performance reasons, since uploading and unpacking huge files takes some time, which endangers Sigrid CI\'s goal of providing quick feedback. Note that based on our experience 99% of repositories easily fit within this limit. Also, Sigrid will only measure the actual source code maintained by your development team. Other artifacts, such as libraries, binaries, or other non-source files are excluded.

### Can I exclude certain files from being uploaded?

Yes. In general, we only need to receive the actual source code, configuration and data is not required to perform the analysis and can be excluded from the upload.

Some files and directories are already excluded by default, based on common conventions for common technologies. For example, the following would be excluded automatically:

- The `node_modules` directory is excluded by default as it contains [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) libraries
- The `target` directory is excluded as it contains build output from [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

In addition to that, you can also exclude files and directories specifically for your project. This is done using the `--exclude` parameter, which is explained in the [configuration documentation](../sigridci-integration/integration.md) page.

### Do Sigrid CI uploads get added to the Sigrid dashboard?

No. This is intentional: Sigrid CI tends to operate on pull requests, which are often branches that are a work-in-progress and still need to be reviewed. Adding every single build to the Sigrid dashboard would create a lot of noise, which makes it harder to use the dashboard for spotting trends and reporting. This is why there are two separate streams of uploads: one used for Sigrid CI (based on branches/pull requests), and one used to feed the Sigrid dashboard (based on a relatively stable branch, such as main).

Of course, one size doesn\'t fit all. Post-beta versions of Sigrid CI will at least give the *option* to also publish uploads to the Sigrid dashboard, so that every team can decide for themselves which uploads should be visible in the dashboard and which should not.

### What branch or commit does Sigrid CI compare against?

Feedback is based on comparing the source code against the current baseline in Sigrid. In other words, this depends on the branch you\'re using to populate the Sigrid dashboard. This would typically be the main branch, though for some teams the baseline could also be based on a release branch, the development branch, or an improvement branch. The baseline therefore depends on the team\'s way of working and branching strategy.

### Why am I being penalized for problems that were already there?

We created Sigrid CI to be used during code reviews, so the feedback is based on only the files you touched during your pull request, not the whole system.

However, we do consider the *entire* contents of those files, not only the lines that you personally wrote. This is because of the [boy scout rule](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch08.html): *"Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it."*. Refactoring and regular work are not two separate activities, they belong together. Having separate tickets to refactor certain areas is OK, but it indicates that something went wrong earlier in the process, that led to those issues being introduced in the first place. Ideally, small refactorings should be done *during* regular tickets. That means that any tickets affecting existing files should not *only* consist of implementing the new behavior. You should also strive to make small refactorings that relate to the code you\'re currently working on. You have the files open anyway!

This concurrent approach to technical debt is also described in the [agile development process workflow](../workflows/agile-development-process.md#for-maintainability-focus-on-technical-debt-that-is-affecting-you-right-now).

### Why are architecture metrics excluded from Sigrid CI?

There are limits to the amount of refactoring you can do in the context of a single ticket. It\'s probably not a good idea to change the entire architecture while working on a bug fix. This is why Sigrid CI reports on a subset of [SIG\'s maintainability quality model](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/methodologies/iso-iec-25010-2011-standard/): the code-level metrics are in scope, but the architecture-level metrics are not. This is due to the difference in *local* versus *global* refactorings. Making some changes in the context of a file tend to be fairly local, in that they don\'t affect a lot of other people. This is why those types of refactoring are fine to work on during regular development work. In contrast, architectural refactoring will have a big impact on a lot of people, so this is something that needs more consideration and needs to be planned separately.

Let us know if you believe we *should* provide feedback on architecture metrics in Sigrid CI, as we are considering to offer it as an option in a future version.

### Should we fail the build if the Sigrid CI check fails?

That\'s obviously your decision and something that depends on your development process. However, if you\'re asking our advice, we would say a failing Sigrid CI check should produce a warning rather than an error. That might seem like ridiculous advice coming from a company that creates software quality tooling, but we can explain.

One of Sigrid\'s key goals is making software quality advice *reasonable*. It\'s easy to invent a thousand quality checks and making them all mandatory, failing the build as soon as a single violation is found. It\'s obviously possible to fix every single issue, but it\'s probably not worth it considering what you get in return. Sigrid focuses on a relatively limited set of metrics, to avoid overloading developers with tons of instructions. Moreover, a small amount of non-conformities is tolerated, as long as the overall quality doesn\'t drop below a certain level.

We therefore believe in a comply-or-explain model. Obviously, you should still strive to pass the Sigrid CI check in the overwhelming majority of cases. However, in the rare cases the check fails, it\'s perfectly OK for the reviewer to overrule the check and accept the pull request, as long as the reviewer finds that the author had good reasons for deviating from the best practice in that particular case.

### Why does deleted code not influence the rating?

In general, deleting code improves maintainability. The less code you have, the less you have to maintain. Having less code also makes it easier to make structural changes, since such changes will require less effort. So if you navigate in Sigrid, you may find its effects. The exact consequences depend on how "good or bad" the deleted code was compared to the rest of the codebase, since volume is the common denominator for the maintainability metrics ([See for more details the technical documentation](../reference/sig-quality-models.md)).

So why does Sigrid CI only give ratings based on new and changed code, but doesn\'t reward you for deleting code? This is mostly to keep the rating simple: combining code quality and deleted code INTO rag.a single metric would make it hard to understand. Also, the majority of pull requests are about adding new code or changing existing code, deleting code is less common, so we have chosen to not optimize for that scenario.

### We have a multi-repo project, can I still use Sigrid CI?

Yes. In some situations, the view of your project/system in Sigrid might differ from your repository structure. For example, you might have separate repositories for your back-end and front-end, yet Sigrid combines them INTO rag.one big system.

There are two ways to use Sigrid CI in such a situation.

- You can change the structure in Sigrid to match your repositories. This is the simplest option, but different roles
  can have different opinions on what is a suitable structure in Sigrid (though development teams tend to prefer Sigrid
  matching their repositories).
- Even when *not* changing the Sigrid structure, it is still possible to run Sigrid CI for your repository. You can use
  the `--subsystem` option to explain Sigrid CI how your repository structure should be matched to your Sigrid
  configuration. This option is explained in [using the Sigrid CI client script](../reference/client-script-usage.md).

## Why are there differences between the directory structure as we see it in our IDE and Sigrid components?

Your system may be defined/scoped in a different way than simply mapping directories as components. Scoping choices als allows for specific filtering and componentization. See the [scope configuration page](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md). If there are any differences you will notice them in the [Code Explorer](../capabilities/system-code-explorer.md#different-views-directory-or-component-structure).

### Can I see which files are uploaded to Sigrid?

Yes. You can add the `--showupload` option when calling the [client script](../reference/client-script-usage.md). This will add log output for every file that is included in the upload that is submitted to Sigrid.

### Why do you have both publish and publishonly options, what is the difference?

The [list of Sigrid CI options](../reference/client-script-usage.md) lists two options with similar names and descriptions, `--publish` and `--publishonly`. These options support slightly different scenarios:

- `--publish` publishes your project\'s source code to Sigrid, *and* provides feedback on your changes within your Continuous Integration environment.
- `--publishonly` also publishes your code to Sigrid, but it *does not* provide feedback within the Continuous Integration environment.

So which one should you use? That depends on your development process. If you use pull requests, you can use `--publishonly`. In this scenario, you\'ve already received feedback for your pull request, so there is no need to receive the same feedback again when you merge your changes to your main/master branch. If you *do not* use pull requests, or if you are not sure, it is best to use `--publish` since it will give you the most feedback.

## Common problems

### What to do when the script does not work?

The Sigrid CI Python script is currently under active development, which means that its subject to change, and namely, its dependencies are subject to change as we add new functionality.
Sigrid CI requires Python 3.7 or higher.
In some cases multiple python versions are installed in the environment and the wrong one (below 3.7) may be selected automatically. If that is the case, please make sure that the highest version is set to be the default.
When not using Docker to run the script, this requires that the dependencies in the environment in which the script is being ran are in sync with the actual code, and, in order to do that, you can run either `pip install -r requirement.txt` or `pipenv install`, when using Python virtual environments.

### I\'m receiving an error message that certificate verification failed

In some cases, the Sigrid CI client script might produce an error message `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate`. This indicates that Python is unable to access the system\'s certificate store. Sigrid CI does not need any special or custom certificates, access to the regular system certificates is sufficient.

If your environment requires a certificate store in a custom location, the environment variables `openssl_cafile_env` and `openssl_capath_envz` can be used to point Python to the correct location. Refer to the [Python documentation on OpenSSL](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html) for more information

### I used the subsystem option and see results from other subsystems

If your repository is part of a larger system you can use subsystem to only get feedback on your repository. This is
done on a best effort basis, and if multiple pipelines run at the same time for the same system this might influence the results.
To give you feedback on your changes Sigrid CI uses both the source code and measurement results from the last published
measurement. If new results are published while we retrieve these measurements, some discrepancies might occur. If this
happens, try running Sigrid CI again, preferably at a quieter moment. If it is a recurring issue,
please [contact us](mailto:support@softwareimprovementgroup.com).

### Where do I find the Sigrid CI output ?

The results of the SigridCI run are logged in the terminal output and optional as a html artefact. For the artefact to be stored you will need to specify the Sigrid CI output path in your yml. Check out the examples for GitHub and GitLab.

### I started using Sigrid CI, and now I suddenly see more code in Sigrid

Sigrid supports multiple ways to upload source code. This documentation covers Sigrid CI, but we also support uploads via SFTP. If you previously used SFTP and then switch to Sigrid CI, you might see some differences. For example, you might suddenly see extra code, or extra components. This is caused by differences in how the upload is created. Unfortunately that means there is no "quick fix" outside of updating your configuration. We are happy to help you with identifying the changes, so please [contact us](mailto:support@softwareimprovementgroup.com) and we\'ll try to help you out.

This also means that we recommend you to either use Sigrid CI or SFTP uploads, but not both. Using two ways of uploading means both uploads need to be consistent, otherwise you\'ll end up with expected changes in Sigrid. In practice this is not always convenient, so if you\'re using Sigrid CI we recommend you stop using SFTP and just Sigrid CI for all uploading/publishing to Sigrid.

### I\'m receiving an error message about UnicodeEncodeError

In some environments, Sigrid CI can produce the following error:

    UnicodeEncodeError: \'charmap\' codec can\'t encode characters

This happens when Sigrid CI tried to provide command line output that includes UTF-8 characters, but `stdout` is unable to display such errors. This can be solved by adding the `export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8` environment variable.

### I\'m receiving an error message about dubious ownership in repository

This message occurs when the (Linux) user that cloned your Git repository is different from the (Linux) user that is running the CI job. This scenario is pretty uncommon, in the majority of cases the entire CI pipeline is performed with the same user. If you see this error, you can add `git config --global --add safe.directory <repository-dir>` to tell Git it is safe to trust the directory to which the repository was cloned. Note you need to provide the directory\'s absolute path, Git will not allow `.`.

## Infrastructure and security questions

### How do you protect our source code?

SIG is ISO/IEC 27001 certified, to ensure information security management and appropriate levels of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data.

You can find more information on SIG\'s infrastructure and security protections in the [Information Security Policy](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/SIG_Information_Security_Policy.pdf).

### Where is your service hosted?

Sigrid, including Sigrid CI, is hosted on Amazon Web Services. If you have specific questions on our infrastructure, please [contact us](mailto:support@softwareimprovementgroup.com).

### Do we need to update our firewall settings?

Possibly. As mentioned above, Sigrid is hosted on AWS. This means your firewall needs to allow outgoing traffic in order to submit your project\'s source code to Sigrid. In practical terms this means the following:

- Allow outbound traffic to `sigrid-says.com` on port 443
- Allow outbound traffic to `auth.sigrid-says.com` on port 443
- Allow outbound traffic to `sig-sigrid-ci-upload.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` on port 443

[Contact SIG](mailto:support@softwareimprovementgroup.com) if you need specific information on this setup.

### Do you support people using their own certificates or certificate authority?

Yes, but you will need to explicitly tell Python to trust your certificates.

- First, make sure your certificate `pem` files are accessible from where you are running Sigrid CI.
  - If you are running Sigrid CI from your own environment, simply make sure the location is accessible from your pipeline.
    - In this scenario, Python will automatically pick up certificates from your operating system\'s certificate store, meaning you should not need manual configuration.
    - If the above does not work for your particular operating system, you can also use the environment variables from the next option.
  - If you are using Docker-based Sigrid CI, you will need to mount this location to make it available to the Docker container.
    - Next, point Python to where to find your PEM files by updating the following environment variables:
      - `SSL_CERT_FILE: /path/to/mounted/cert.pem`
      - `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE: /path/to/mounted/cert.pem`

## About Objectives

**Objectives** are targets that can be set in Sigrid, to compare against system status and quality trends. In this context, objectives are understood as being *non-functional requirements*. They are considered separate from metadata (see [metadata page](../organization-integration/metadata.md)), since *Objectives* do not describe characteristics of systems themselves, but where you want them to be.

Objectives can be set per different quality characteristics and levels of detail. Examples are: a range of desired *Maintainability*, desired *New code quality*, minimum *Test code ratio*, or the maximum number of *Medium risk vulnerabilities* in libraries (*Open Source Health*).

Our [Guidelines for using Objectives](../workflows/best-practices-objectives.md) provides more background on the thinking behind objectives and how to make them work in your organization. This section focusses on the action needed in Sigrid.

Two types of objectives exist:

**Portfolio Objective**:  A type of objective that targets a group of systems based on similar metadata, aiming to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience that removes the need to set objectives individually for each system and better prioritization. (General rule). Find out more in the section [how to define portofolio objectives](../capabilities/portfolio-objectives.md).

**System Objective**: A type of objective specific to an individual system within a portfolio that does not follow the general rule. When an objective is set at the system level, the system no longer follows the objective defined at the portfolio level.

<img src="../images/portfolio-objectives-system-detail.png" width="700" />

## Setting System Objectives

To Set System Objectives, navigate to your desired system\'s overview page, and Click on Modify Objectives. You can find your desired system from the treemap or search the column under the Treemap.

## How to set Objectives



## Comparing status and objectives in the System Overview page

When set, the status of a system against its goals is shown in the *System Overview* tab, as shown below.

<img src="../images/objectives-overview.png" width="750" />

Objectives show the evolution of the system quality over time. Thereby they are useful for [roles](../getting-started/roles.md) such as Enterprise Architects to see where technical debt is moving. It also has a signaling function to make explicit what goals teams should be working towards, and therefore, how the portfolio ought to be moving. This is, of course, only meaningful if these targets/thresholds have been agreed upon beforehand with teams/Product Owners/Development managers, etc.

## Understanding Objectives in detail: System Overview page

Objectives can be set as below on the *System Overview* page:

<img src="../images/objectives-system.png" width="600" />

There are six different columns which mean the following:

1. *Status* checkmark: The leftmost checkmark is a visual indicator that tells you whether the target for an objective is being met in the currently analyzed snapshot.
The green checkmark shows that the test code ratio is at least 80% and that the maintainability rating target is also being met.
2. *Capability* column: A *Capability* can be understood as a desirable code quality characteristic where an objective falls into.
3. *Type* column: The *Type* indicates the type of the objective which is dependent on the capability. Examples of types of objectives include: Maintainability, Dependency Upgrade Period, Test Code Ratio, etc.
4. *Target* column: The *Target* is the desired measurable value of the objective. It is important to revisit this periodically, because targets will likely vary over time. A likely cause for a target change is the system\'s *Lifecycle*. Similarly, *Business criticality* typically also is a determinant.
5. *Delta* column: The delta can have several values: Achieved, Improved, Unchanged, Unknown and Worsened.
6. *Level* column: The level at which an objective is being applied: it can either be a specific system-level objective override, that only applies to a specific system (System in the table) or it can be a portfolio-level objective that applies to all systems in a portfolio.

### Detailed information about the Delta column

Objectives are measured for a specific code snapshot, which will typically fall within the selected period in the UI. The delta column attempts to present a comprehensive overview of the relationship between the delta and the state of an objective at the start and the end of the period.
The relationship between these three values is what defines the value that gets displayed in the column, according to the table below:

===========================================================

The [Sigrid CI documentation](../sigridci-integration/development-workflows.md) contains instructions on how you can integrate Sigrid INTO rag.your development platform, which allows you to publish your code to Sigrid after every change. That section of the documentation contains instructions for common development platforms, for example GitHub or Azure DevOps.

This page contains some additional instructions on how you can best publish your system\'s open source libraries to Sigrid, so that they can be analyzed by Sigrid and shown in the [Open Source Health](system-open-source-health) page. The official, though somewhat obscure, term for this information is a [SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom).

First of all, it is not necessary to submit the *binaries* for every library. If your system uses a dependency management tool, it is usually sufficient to send the corresponding configuration files. For example, Maven uses `pom.xml` to list dependencies, Gradle uses `build.gradle`, and NPM uses `package.json`. If any of those files are included in your repository, they will be picked up automatically.

However, in some cases there might be extra options or caveats when using certain dependency management tools. The sections below contain some more specific instructions to take INTO rag.consideration when using one of those dependency management tools. Also refer to [supported dependency management tools and open source ecosystems](../reference/technology-support.md) for a complete list of all supported technologies.

## Maven

### Maven properties

Maven properties are supported. It is quite common to define library versions as Maven properties:

    <properties>
        <guava.version>32.0.1-jre</guava.version>
    </properties>

And then refer to those properties when the dependency is defined.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
        <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
        <version>${guava.version}</version>
    </dependency>

Sigrid understands these properties, and will resolve dependencies to the correct version. This also works if the property is defined in the top-level POM, and then used in the module POMs.

### External parent POMs

Most Maven projects consist of multiple modules, which are then tied together by a "parent POM", which is basically just a top-level `pom.xml` that contains shared configuration across the entire project.

In some cases, the parent POM itself *also* has a parent POM. This usually refers to a POM file which is shared across the entire organization, and tends to contain shared configuration across all projects in the organization. Having such an organization-wide used to be reasonably wide-spread, but is becoming increasingly rare as people move towards more independent repositories that do not have code dependencies on other repositories.

Sigrid is able to scan the parent POM, but only if the parent POM is included in the source code that was published. And that\'s a problem, because as we just established these parent POMs are usually *not* part of the repository (by definition, as they contain all shared configuration across repositories). And if the parent POM is not published to Sigrid, then Sigrid is not able to read the file.

If you want Sigrid to scan your parent POM without having to include its original file in your upload, you can also generate a [Maven dependency report](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/tree-mojo.html) and upload that to Sigrid. You can generate this report from the command line, as part of your build pipeline:

    mvn dependency:tree > maven.tree

If Sigrid finds both POM files and the `maven.tree` file in your upload, the `maven.tree` file takes precedence.

Note that you need to run this command *before* you publish your code to Sigrid, otherwise the file will not end up in the upload. Also note that it is not necessary to commit this file to your repository, generating it on-the-fly in the pipeline is sufficient for Sigrid.

## Gradle

Unlike most other dependency management tools, Gradle does not use a configuration file format like XML or JSON or YAML. Instead, it uses a full-blown programming language (originally Groovy, but Kotlin build scripts are also supported in newer versions). Gradle build scripts are therefore incredibly flexible, but they are also much harder to analyze for tools like Sigrid.

If you use the configuration DSL to define your dependencies, Sigrid will automatically pick them up.

    dependencies {
        api "com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.8"
        testImplementation "org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.7.2"
    }

Defining dependencies in this way will work just fine. However, there are much more flexible ways. You can define `ext` properties. You can define properties in `gradle.properties`. You can have full-blown Groovy/Kotlin logic. If you project uses these dynamic features, Sigrid might not be able to pick up all dependencies (again, it\'s hard to say where the line is exactly, since Gradle is so flexible).

However, Gradle also supports [lockfiles](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html). These lockfiles define exactly which libraries and version are used by your projects, and are committed to your repository. If your codebase contains a Gradle lockfile, Sigrid will use this lockfile instead of `build.gradle`. This ensures Sigrid is able to extract all of your project\'s dependencies. Note that using a lockfile is a best practice even without considering Sigrid, as this allows for fully reproducible builds. Sigrid will only consider lockfiles when transitive scanning is set to true.

### NPM

NPM dependencies are defined in `package.json`, but NPM also generates a [lockfile](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json) called `package-lock.json`. Since the lockfile defines the exact versions, Sigrid will prioritize the lockfile over the regular `package.json`.

### Yarn

Yarn is very similar to NPM, but its lockfile is called `yarn.lock` instead of NPM\'s `package-lock.json`. Like for NPM, Sigrid will prioritize the lockfile over `package.json` during its analysis.

### Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is a Python dependency management tool, that is sometimes used as an alternative to the more popular PIP. Sigrid currently only supports analyzing the Poetry lockfile, which is called `poetry.lock`. This lockfile needs to be included in the codebase that is published to Sigrid, and is then analyzed automatically. Do note that [using a Poetry lockfile is a best practice](https://python-poetry.org), so there are good reasons for using this lockfile even beyond Sigrid.

### Other dependency management tools

This page provides some additional instructions and explanation for commonly used dependency management tools. For the complete list of all supportec technologies, refer to the [supported dependency management tools and open source ecosystems](../reference/technology-support.md).

## Navigating to the portfolio Maintainability view
If you have a portfolio of systems in Sigrid, maintainability is always available as a capability. You can navigate to the maintainability view via the top bar:

<img src="../images/portfolio-overview-top-bar.png" width="600" />

Another way to arrive here is clicking on the top capability tiles on the *Portfolio Overview* page. See the [portfolio overview page](portfolio-overview.md#navigating-between-portfolio-and-system-level-views).

Your URL will be of the convention https://sigrid-says.com/*[clientname]*/-/maintainability/.

## Moving from portfolio-level to system-level view
Since the portfolio view is a summary of system level findings, please refer to the [system-level view of maintainability](system-maintainability.md). For example, clicking on a system name in the portfolio overview will bring you to the system\'s details.

## Portfolio-level Maintainability overview

The maintainability section on the portfolio level has two main views: *Overview* and *Delta quality*. Both views include all the systems of your portfolio in one place.

<img src="../images/portfolio-maintainability-menu.png" width="150" />

### Maintainability view

The *Overview* tab brings the main metrics together. For the systems combined, it summarizes their (change in) volume and maintainability.

<img src="../images/portfolio-maintainability.png" width="600" />

### Delta quality view

The *Delta quality* view shows the impact of code changes on the entire portfolio for the selected period. By default it shows you "*New code*", the first of three tabs. In the treemap the results are grouped per system. Just like other Sigrid pages, the characteristics can be changed by their drop-down menus (here:"*Color*", "*Area*", "*Grouping*" and "*Annotations*"). So note that the summaries in the top tiles adjust to whether you have selected "*New code*", "*Changed code*" or "*New & changed code*".

<img src="../images/portfolio-delta-quality-new-code.png" width="600" />

By clicking on a system, either on the treemap or the list below, you will move to the system view for *Delta Quality* in the same tab as you are viewing now ("*New code*", "*Changed code*" or "*New & changed code*"). Please see [Delta quality on a system-level](system-delta-quality.md) for elaboration on system-specifics. Generally, the "*New code*" delta tells you whether new developments are able to follow best practices (assuming that code change heuristics picked up those files correctly as being new, as opposed to moved or renamed). The impact of "*Changed code quality*" really depends on the size of the change. If 1 line of code has been changed, the code quality will probably stay the same. If that happens to be (older) code with lower quality, it is not necessarily alarming. A more balanced view will be visible in the "*New & changed code*" tab, which averages out changes to new and existing code. A sanity check is to see whether portfolio-wide metrics have actually changed (in the [Maintainability Overview tab, see above](#portfolio-level-maintainability-overview)).

<img src="../images/filter-2.png" class="inline" /> With the help of the top right funnel/filter icon, the information can be filtered and sorted by metadata (such as supplier, team, or division). By default it shows (2) active filters: "*Hide excluded systems*" and "*Hide deactivated systems*".

Please see [the system-level overview page](system-overview.md) under *Maintainability:4* for elaboration.

## Analysis questions for portfolio/trend views
To gauge portfolio health and portfolio trends, example analysis questions are:
* Is the portfolio balanced with business objectives and (enterprise) architecture roadmaps?
* Do some systems appear to be in trouble while they should have a long life ahead of them? Are quality trends heading in the right direction?
* Which direction is technical debt moving? Does this impede developers to support the business with sufficient speed and quality?

## Portfolio view by system lifecycle phase
Below, systems are grouped by lifecycle phase. A lifecycle phase is an indication of a system’s maturity and "adaptability needs", their expected path of continuation. They range from: Initial development > Evolution > Servicing & maintenance > End-of-life. You will generally expect to see a higher maintainability for younger systems (Initial development and Evolution), because they have a long time of changes ahead of them. Lower code quality early on in a system’s life will hurt more over the long term than it would for a system that is already considered "end-of-life".
Setting this lifecycle metadata is discussed in the [metadata page](../organization-integration/metadata.md), or specifically its section on the [Sigrid API metadata end point page](../integrations/sigrid-api-documentation.md#lifecycle-phase).

<img src="../images/help-button.png" class="inline" /> The "?" help buttons explain the meaning of the different types of settings.

<img src="../images/portfolio-lifecycle-phase-maintainability.png" width="600" />

The maintainability ratings expressed in (rounded) stars are distinguished by "traffic light colors", ranging from red (1 star) to green (5 stars).

<img src="../images/maintainability-star-color-scheme.png" width="300" />

Note that the snapshots dates in the top-right corner always imply a period, but it will assume the last date as a state, unless you select a viewing option that shows change, such as "Maintainability change".

## Portfolio view menus
You can create different views by system characteristics. The characteristics under **Grouping** and **Area** will change the ordering and size of the systems within the treemap. **Color** and **Annotation** will add extra information on top, as a color scheme or annotation. A complete menu of viewing options is shown below.

<img src="../images/portfolio-menus-treemap.png" width="600" />

Here, "*Maintainability change*" is chosen as the meaning of the color scheme. The relative changes are colored as white (neutral) up to green (improving) and red (deteriorating), based on the period selected above (in this example, Year-To-Date/YTD). This can be useful as trend analysis, comparing to expectations. Generally, you would expect public-facing systems to be more actively maintained because outside users tend to come up with new requests, bug reports, and requirements for e.g. stability. As a simplification, you would expect actively maintained systems to not (or very little) deteriorate in code quality. Switching between views of "*Maintainability change*" in different grouping will give you an idea of the balance between expected- and actual trends.

<img src="../images/portfolio-system-type-maintainability-change.png" width="600" />

You can filter per division/team/supplier on different quality aspects, and track the trends of each.

## Trends in the context of and objectives
Whether quality trends are heading in the right direction does depend on context/goals. The expected quality direction is not necessarily only upwards, but could be: restrict deterioration, stabilization, or cutting volume as a priority. This is why [quality objectives](objectives.md) are important. System-/portfolio quality overviews and their standing on helps getting a shared understanding and commitment towards quality of systems and the portfolio.

## Using quality trend lines
On a trend line, quality trends can help you see movements over time, possibly fuelled by specific (renovation/development) events. In the below example, a portfolio\'s code quality over time is shown per system.

<img src="../images/portfolio-trendline-technology.png" width="600" />

Systems can be (un)selected on the bottom of the graph.

## About Objectives

**Objectives** are targets that can be set in Sigrid, to compare against system status and quality trends. In this context, objectives are understood as being *non-functional requirements*. They are considered separate from metadata (see [metadata page](../organization-integration/metadata.md)), since *Objectives* do not describe characteristics of systems themselves, but where you want them to be.

Objectives can be set per different quality characteristics and levels of detail. Examples are: a range of desired *Maintainability*, desired *New code quality*, minimum *Test code ratio*, or the maximum number of *Medium risk vulnerabilities* in libraries (*Open Source Health*).

Our [Guidelines for using Objectives](../workflows/best-practices-objectives.md) provides more background on the thinking behind objectives and how to make them work in your organization. This section focusses on the action needed in Sigrid.

Two types of objectives exist:

**Portfolio Objective**:  A type of objective that targets a group of systems based on similar metadata, aiming to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience that removes the need to set objectives individually for each system and better prioritization. (General rule).

<img src="../images/portfolio-objectives-main-table.png" width="700" />

**System Objective**: A type of objective specific to an individual system within a portfolio that does not follow the general rule. When an objective is set at the system level, the system no longer follows the objective defined at the portfolio level.

Find out more in the section [how to define system objectives](../capabilities/objectives.md).

## How to define portfolio objectives?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giNCbqQ9pnI?si=ktrKsYsx2uJmOL5Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can set Portfolio Objectives by selecting the Objectives tab from the menu bar.

<img src="../images/setting-portfolio-objectives.png" width="675" />

To define a portfolio objective, you can click on the "Add Portfolio Objective" button on the top right of the screen:

<img src="../images/portfolio-objectives-add-arrow.png" width="700" />

Upon clicking the button, a pop-up will appear to guide you during the creation of a portfolio objective.

The pop-up will guide you toward configuring the portfolio objective:

<img src="../images/portfolio-objectives-add-popup-step1.png" width="700" />

There are several dropdown menus available in the pop-up.

- A Capability dropdown, that allows you to select the specific capability for which the portfolio objective will be defined.
- The Type dropdown allows you to select a given objective type that is part of the capability selected in the previous step. In the example, we see that Test Code Ratio is set as a type. This is because the "Test Code Ratio" objective is a type of objective that belongs to the Maintainability capability.
-  Then, we can define the actual value that we want our portfolio objective to be.
This final field can be of two distinct types: either a free-text field, in the case of numeric objectives, or a dropdown containing a series of pre-defined values, that will be the allowed values for the given objective type.

<img src="../images/portfolio-objectives-add-popup-step2.png" width="700" />

- Once you are done with selecting the type of objective you want to define, you can then start applying the objective to a group of systems based on their shared metadata. You can apply objectives based on the system\'s technology category, Business criticality, Life cycle phase or deployment type.
Being able to set system-specific objectives can help you evaluate your system realistically, based on the system’s context. For example, you can set a specific quality objective for a system that is programmed using legacy technologies or a system that is end-of-life. It\'s important to prioritize and set higher or lower targets (= different objectives) for certain systems.  For example, systems that are public-facing might have stronger security objectives, or systems built with legacy technology might have lower maintainability objectives.
- Finally, we have a free-text field called Rationale. This field can be used to add any additional details on why a given objective was set and add extra details regarding the values for ensuring full clarity to all involved stakeholders.


## Importance of the Rationale field

One of the main goals of portfolio objectives is that they allow you to codify business objectives in Sigrid.
A portfolio objective is not, exclusively a technical objective, but, it’s also a business objective for your portfolio.

The idea behind the "Rationale" field, is that it opens up communication between development teams and the management side, in a two-way fashion: when technical goals are linked to business goals, that creates a storyline that resonates well with management, since business goals are their priority. Simultaneously, when  business goals are linked to technical goals, from the lens of the developers, that gives them the perspective on what business goal the technical work they are doing will eventually contribute to.
An example can be as follows: consider a legacy modernization scenario, where older systems are being rewritten in a more modern version of a given technology. And, let’s assume, that in order to guide that process, a quality standard is agreed upon by all stakeholders: a maintainability rating of 4.0 stars is enforced for all systems, to ensure that the re-write doesn’t degrade the existing quality.
That is an important business goal for you and, with portfolio objectives, that business expectation can be seen and monitored through Sigrid.


## Relation between system-level objectives and portfolio-level objectives

The system level and portfolio level objectives are closely related to each other, but, there are several important details to be aware of.

Portfolio-level objectives are like policies. Every policy can have exceptions, but, simultaneously, it\'s important that there is a more general policy to fall back on. These objectives are intended to be used across a wide range of systems, and, are meant to be defined based on the metadata for these systems.
In other words: the effectiveness and usefulness of portfolio-level objectives will be directly related to the quality and level of granularity of the metadata.
In order for you to define effective portfolio-level objectives, you first need to define the "corresponding" metadata. Metadata is, just like the name indicates, data about your systems. An example, which we described at the beginning of this text, can be categorizing a system based on its business criticality and its lifecycle phase. Not all systems will be equally critical nor will all of them be greenfield projects backed by the most modern technologies.
The ability to tell Sigrid exactly how each of your systems fits INTO rag.your business, as well as your software landscape, is what the metadata is about.

The portfolio-level objectives will act as a fallback in case no system-level objectives are defined, but, if they are, they will override the portfolio-level ones.


### Practical scenario

As an admin, you target a subset of your systems, for which you set a high test code ratio percentage, such as 90%.

Then, during the day-to-day work, since one of these systems is being completely revamped, a system-level override is defined, that sets the test code ratio to only 70%, to be less strict.

From this point onwards, the system-level override will be the only one in effect, and this particular system will not be affected by the portfolio-level target.
Once the developers finish their work, they no longer require the objective to be there, so, they remove it.
Upon removing it, the system-level override disappears, and, simultaneously, the portfolio-level objective comes INTO rag.effect again, making the newly revamped system subjected to the higher quality standard set by the portfolio-level objective.

If you have a portfolio of systems in Sigrid and licenses enabled for Security or Open Source Health, they will be visible in the top bar.

<img src="../images/portfolio-overview-top-bar-open-source-health-focus.png" width="750" />

Your URL will be of the convention https://sigrid-says.com/*[clientname]*/-/open-source-health, whereas system details will follow https://sigrid-says.com/*[clientname]*/*systemname*/-/open-source-health.

Another way to arrive here is clicking on the top capability tiles on the *Portfolio overview* page. See the [portfolio overview page](portfolio-overview.md#navigating-between-portfolio-and-system-level-views).

## Moving from portfolio level to system level
Since the portfolio view is a summary of system level findings, please refer to the [system-level view of Open Source Health](system-open-source-health.md). For example, clicking on a system name in the portfolio overview will bring you to the system\'s details.

## 6 different risk areas
It is important to know how Open Source Health groups its findings. Open Source Health scans for 6 different risk areas. For an elaboration, please [see the relevant paragraph in the page describing system-level view of Open Source Health](system-open-source-health.md#open-source-health-scans-for-6-different-risk-areas). Risks are then classified and colored as <img src="../images/system-security-icon-low1.png" class="inline" /> *low*, <img src="../images/system-security-icon-medium1.png" class="inline" /> *medium*, <img src="../images/system-security-icon-high1.png" class="inline" /> *high*, or <img src="../images/system-security-icon-critical1.png" class="inline"> *critical* based on their *CVSS score*. See also [our elaboration on how CVSS works](system-security.md#context-and-meaning-of-cvss-security-metrics-from-asset-to-risk) and on [how risks are visualized in Sigrid](system-security.md#cvss-scores-in-sigrid).

## Portfolio-level Open Source Health overview
The Open Source Health overview page shows a summary of findings and estimated severity.

<img src="../images/portfolio-open-source-health-overview.png" width="800" />

From left to right, the tiles read as follows:
* *Systems and libraries*: the totals of systems being scanned and the sum of identified (third party) libraries.
* *Systems with vulnerability/legal/freshness/.. risk*: the count of systems with at least 1 identified risk, ordered by risk category (e.g. *low*, *medium*, *high* or *critical*).
* *Libraries with vulnerability/legal/freshness/..risk*: the total count of libraries in each risk category, transcending systems.

The aforementioned 6 categories are present on the bottom of the tiles that show the sum of number of risks.

<img src="../images/system-osh-risk-barchart-bottom-icons.png" width="400" />

<img src="../images/help-corner-osh.png" class="inline" /> The help button in the tile\'s upper right corner shows mouseovers for each category that you select.

In the bottom part of the screen, each system is shown with a summary of its counts: number of libraries and findings per category. For larger portfolios it may be useful to sort these on different characteristics. Its menu, by default set on sorting order by "*Risk*", is as follows:

<img src="../images/portfolio-open-source-health-sorting-risk.png" width="100" />

Sorting can also be done per columns (here, "*Vulnerability*" as an example). The top right bottom for exporting the data as a spreadsheet may be useful for further analysis.

<img src="../images/portfolio-open-source-health-sorting-columns-vulnerability-focus.png" width="600" />

## Filtering internal dependencies
Internal dependencies can be filtered manually, such that they will not be resolved with the Open Source Health APIs that Sigrid uses.
[Please see the Open Source Health paragraph in our scope configuration document](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#open-source-health) or [this related question in the FAQ](../capabilities/faq-security.md#does-sig-filter-when-resolving-our-systems-dependencies).

Haiyun Xu: We are celebrating Sanne’s 10 year anniversary at SIG :tada:. Sanne made wonderful cakes. If you would like some, join us in the kitchen. Let’s thank together to Sanne for her great work in the past 10 years :grinning:.
Chushu Gao: A kindly reminder! Today from 16:00 to 17:00, we have a guest presenter Justus Bogner (VU) giving a talk in our research guild meeting on: “The Challenge of Designing Green ML-Enabled Systems: A Software Architecture Perspective” .

With 3 buzzwords (Green, ML, and software architecture), this is bound to interest many (technically inclined) of you :slightly_smiling_face:

Pepijn van de Kamp: I can recommend to watch this 5 minute video from Henrik Kniberg (the famous ex-Spotify Chief Scientist) on how LLMs can be used for enormous productivity gains in rapid prototyping. In my opinion this is a bit of a look INTO rag.the future to see where this could go and where GenAI actually does make sense for making Software Engineering more efficient.

## Portfolio-level Open Source Health overview
The Open Source Health overview page shows a summary of findings and estimated severity.

<img src="../images/portfolio-open-source-health-overview.png" width="800" />

From left to right, the tiles read as follows:
* *Systems and libraries*: the totals of systems being scanned and the sum of identified (third party) libraries.
* *Systems with vulnerability/legal/freshness/.. risk*: the count of systems with at least 1 identified risk, ordered by risk category (e.g. *low*, *medium*, *high* or *critical*).
* *Libraries with vulnerability/legal/freshness/..risk*: the total count of libraries in each risk category, transcending systems.

The aforementioned 6 categories are present on the bottom of the tiles that show the sum of number of risks.

<img src="../images/system-osh-risk-barchart-bottom-icons.png" width="400" />

If you have a portfolio of systems in Sigrid and licenses enabled for Security or Open Source Health, they will be visible in the top bar.

<img src="../images/portfolio-overview-top-bar-open-source-health-focus.png" width="750" />

Your URL will be of the convention https://sigrid-says.com/*[clientname]*/-/open-source-health, whereas system details will follow https://sigrid-says.com/*[clientname]*/*systemname*/-/open-source-health.

Another way to arrive here is clicking on the top capability tiles on the *Portfolio overview* page. See the [portfolio overview page](portfolio-overview.md#navigating-between-portfolio-and-system-level-views).

## Moving from portfolio level to system level
Since the portfolio view is a summary of system level findings, please refer to the [system-level view of Open Source Health](system-open-source-health.md). For example, clicking on a system name in the portfolio overview will bring you to the system\'s details.

## 6 different risk areas
It is important to know how Open Source Health groups its findings. Open Source Health scans for 6 different risk areas. For an elaboration, please [see the relevant paragraph in the page describing system-level view of Open Source Health](system-open-source-health.md#open-source-health-scans-for-6-different-risk-areas).

To define a portfolio objective, you can click on the "Add Portfolio Objective" button on the top right of the screen:

<img src="../images/portfolio-objectives-add-arrow.png" width="700" />

Upon clicking the button, a pop-up will appear to guide you during the creation of a portfolio objective.

The pop-up will guide you toward configuring the portfolio objective:

<img src="../images/portfolio-objectives-add-popup-step1.png" width="700" />

There are several dropdown menus available in the pop-up.

- A Capability dropdown, that allows you to select the specific capability for which the portfolio objective will be defined.
- The Type dropdown allows you to select a given objective type that is part of the capability selected in the previous step. In the example, we see that Test Code Ratio is set as a type.

Metadata is, just like the name indicates, data about your systems. An example, which we described at the beginning of this text, can be categorizing a system based on its business criticality and its lifecycle phase. Not all systems will be equally critical nor will all of them be greenfield projects backed by the most modern technologies.
The ability to tell Sigrid exactly how each of your systems fits INTO rag.your business, as well as your software landscape, is what the metadata is about.

The portfolio-level objectives will act as a fallback in case no system-level objectives are defined, but, if they are, they will override the portfolio-level ones.


### Practical scenario

As an admin, you target a subset of your systems, for which you set a high test code ratio percentage, such as 90%.

Then, during the day-to-day work, since one of these systems is being completely revamped, a system-level override is defined, that sets the test code ratio to only 70%, to be less strict.

From this point onwards, the system-level override will be the only one in effect, and this particular system will not be affected by the portfolio-level target.
Once the developers finish their work, they no longer require the objective to be there, so, they remove it.

An example can be as follows: consider a legacy modernization scenario, where older systems are being rewritten in a more modern version of a given technology. And, let’s assume, that in order to guide that process, a quality standard is agreed upon by all stakeholders: a maintainability rating of 4.0 stars is enforced for all systems, to ensure that the re-write doesn’t degrade the existing quality.
That is an important business goal for you and, with portfolio objectives, that business expectation can be seen and monitored through Sigrid.


## Relation between system-level objectives and portfolio-level objectives

The system level and portfolio level objectives are closely related to each other, but, there are several important details to be aware of.

Portfolio-level objectives are like policies. Every policy can have exceptions, but, simultaneously, it\'s important that there is a more general policy to fall back on.

- Once you are done with selecting the type of objective you want to define, you can then start applying the objective to a group of systems based on their shared metadata. You can apply objectives based on the system\'s technology category, Business criticality, Life cycle phase or deployment type.
Being able to set system-specific objectives can help you evaluate your system realistically, based on the system’s context. For example, you can set a specific quality objective for a system that is programmed using legacy technologies or a system that is end-of-life. It\'s important to prioritize and set higher or lower targets (= different objectives) for certain systems.  For example, systems that are public-facing might have stronger security objectives, or systems built with legacy technology might have lower maintainability objectives.
- Finally, we have a free-text field called Rationale. This field can be used to add any additional details on why a given objective was set and add extra details regarding the values for ensuring full clarity to all involved stakeholders.


## Importance of the Rationale field

## About Objectives

**Objectives** are targets that can be set in Sigrid, to compare against system status and quality trends. In this context, objectives are understood as being *non-functional requirements*. They are considered separate from metadata (see [metadata page](../organization-integration/metadata.md)), since *Objectives* do not describe characteristics of systems themselves, but where you want them to be.

Objectives can be set per different quality characteristics and levels of detail. Examples are: a range of desired *Maintainability*, desired *New code quality*, minimum *Test code ratio*, or the maximum number of *Medium risk vulnerabilities* in libraries (*Open Source Health*).

Our [Guidelines for using Objectives](../workflows/best-practices-objectives.md) provides more background on the thinking behind objectives and how to make them work in your organization. This section focusses on the action needed in Sigrid.

Two types of objectives exist:

**Portfolio Objective**:  A type of objective that targets a group of systems based on similar metadata, aiming to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience that removes the need to set objectives individually for each system and better prioritization. (General rule).

<img src="../images/portfolio-objectives-main-table.png" width="700" />

**System Objective**: A type of objective specific to an individual system within a portfolio that does not follow the general rule. When an objective is set at the system level, the system no longer follows the objective defined at the portfolio level.

This can be useful as trend analysis, comparing to expectations. Generally, you would expect public-facing systems to be more actively maintained because outside users tend to come up with new requests, bug reports, and requirements for e.g. stability. As a simplification, you would expect actively maintained systems to not (or very little) deteriorate in code quality. Switching between views of "*Maintainability change*" in different grouping will give you an idea of the balance between expected- and actual trends.

You can filter per division/team/supplier on different quality aspects, and track the trends of each.

## Trends in the context of and objectives
Whether quality trends are heading in the right direction does depend on context/goals. The expected quality direction is not necessarily only upwards, but could be: restrict deterioration, stabilization, or cutting volume as a priority. This is why [quality objectives](objectives.md) are important. System-/portfolio quality overviews and their standing on helps getting a shared understanding and commitment towards quality of systems and the portfolio.

## Using quality trend lines

Setting this lifecycle metadata is discussed in the [metadata page](../organization-integration/metadata.md), or specifically its section on the [Sigrid API metadata end point page](../integrations/sigrid-api-documentation.md#lifecycle-phase).

<img src="../images/help-button.png" class="inline" /> The "?" help buttons explain the meaning of the different types of settings.

<img src="../images/portfolio-lifecycle-phase-maintainability.png" width="600" />

The maintainability ratings expressed in (rounded) stars are distinguished by "traffic light colors", ranging from red (1 star) to green (5 stars).

<img src="../images/maintainability-star-color-scheme.png" width="300" />

Note that the snapshots dates in the top-right corner always imply a period, but it will assume the last date as a state, unless you select a viewing option that shows change, such as "Maintainability change".

## Portfolio view menus
You can create different views by system characteristics. The characteristics under **Grouping** and **Area** will change the ordering and size of the systems within the treemap. **Color** and **Annotation** will add extra information on top, as a color scheme or annotation. A complete menu of viewing options is shown below.

## Analysis questions for portfolio/trend views
To gauge portfolio health and portfolio trends, example analysis questions are:
* Is the portfolio balanced with business objectives and (enterprise) architecture roadmaps?
* Do some systems appear to be in trouble while they should have a long life ahead of them? Are quality trends heading in the right direction?
* Which direction is technical debt moving? Does this impede developers to support the business with sufficient speed and quality?

## Portfolio view by system lifecycle phase
Below, systems are grouped by lifecycle phase. A lifecycle phase is an indication of a system’s maturity and "adaptability needs", their expected path of continuation. They range from: Initial development > Evolution > Servicing & maintenance > End-of-life.

INSERT INTO rag.text_segments (id, document_id, content, metadata, embedding) VALUES (669951194516026365, 669951194516026363, e'In the treemap the results are grouped per system. Just like other Sigrid pages, the characteristics can be changed by their drop-down menus (here:"*Color*", "*Area*", "*Grouping*" and "*Annotations*"). So note that the summaries in the top tiles adjust to whether you have selected "*New code*", "*Changed code*" or "*New & changed code*".

<img src="../images/portfolio-delta-quality-new-code.png" width="600" />

By clicking on a system, either on the treemap or the list below, you will move to the system view for *Delta Quality* in the same tab as you are viewing now ("*New code*", "*Changed code*" or "*New & changed code*"). Please see [Delta quality on a system-level](system-delta-quality.md) for elaboration on system-specifics. Generally, the "*New code*" delta tells you whether new developments are able to follow best practices (assuming that code change heuristics picked up those files correctly as being new, as opposed to moved or renamed). The impact of "*Changed code quality*" really depends on the size of the change. If 1 line of code has been changed, the code quality will probably stay the same. If that happens to be (older) code with lower quality, it is not necessarily alarming. A more balanced view will be visible in the "*New & changed code*" tab, which averages out changes to new and existing code. A sanity check is to see whether portfolio-wide metrics have actually changed (in the [Maintainability Overview tab, see above](#portfolio-level-maintainability-overview)).

## Navigating to the portfolio Maintainability view
If you have a portfolio of systems in Sigrid, maintainability is always available as a capability. You can navigate to the maintainability view via the top bar:

<img src="../images/portfolio-overview-top-bar.png" width="600" />

Another way to arrive here is clicking on the top capability tiles on the *Portfolio Overview* page. See the [portfolio overview page](portfolio-overview.md#navigating-between-portfolio-and-system-level-views).

Your URL will be of the convention https://sigrid-says.com/*[clientname]*/-/maintainability/.

## Moving from portfolio-level to system-level view
Since the portfolio view is a summary of system level findings, please refer to the [system-level view of maintainability](system-maintainability.md). For example, clicking on a system name in the portfolio overview will bring you to the system\'s details.

## Portfolio-level Maintainability overview

The maintainability section on the portfolio level has two main views: *Overview* and *Delta quality*. Both views include all the systems of your portfolio in one place.

<img src="../images/portfolio-maintainability-menu.png" width="150" />

### Maintainability view

The *Overview* tab brings the main metrics together. For the systems combined, it summarizes their (change in) volume and maintainability.

<img src="../images/portfolio-maintainability.png" width="600" />

### Delta quality view

And then refer to those properties when the dependency is defined.

    <dependency>

Sigrid understands these properties, and will resolve dependencies to the correct version. This also works if the property is defined in the top-level POM, and then used in the module POMs.

### External parent POMs

Most Maven projects consist of multiple modules, which are then tied together by a "parent POM", which is basically just a top-level `pom.xml` that contains shared configuration across the entire project.

In some cases, the parent POM itself *also* has a parent POM. This usually refers to a POM file which is shared across the entire organization, and tends to contain shared configuration across all projects in the organization. Having such an organization-wide used to be reasonably wide-spread, but is becoming increasingly rare as people move towards more independent repositories that do not have code dependencies on other repositories.

Sigrid is able to scan the parent POM, but only if the parent POM is included in the source code that was published. And that\'s a problem, because as we just established these parent POMs are usually *not* part of the repository (by definition, as they contain all shared configuration across repositories).

This lockfile needs to be included in the codebase that is published to Sigrid, and is then analyzed automatically. Do note that [using a Poetry lockfile is a best practice](https://python-poetry.org), so there are good reasons for using this lockfile even beyond Sigrid.

You can have full-blown Groovy/Kotlin logic. If you project uses these dynamic features, Sigrid might not be able to pick up all dependencies (again, it\'s hard to say where the line is exactly, since Gradle is so flexible).

However, Gradle also supports [lockfiles](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html). These lockfiles define exactly which libraries and version are used by your projects, and are committed to your repository. If your codebase contains a Gradle lockfile, Sigrid will use this lockfile instead of `build.gradle`. This ensures Sigrid is able to extract all of your project\'s dependencies. Note that using a lockfile is a best practice even without considering Sigrid, as this allows for fully reproducible builds. Sigrid will only consider lockfiles when transitive scanning is set to true.

### NPM

NPM dependencies are defined in `package.json`, but NPM also generates a [lockfile](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json) called `package-lock.json`. Since the lockfile defines the exact versions, Sigrid will prioritize the lockfile over the regular `package.json`.

### Yarn

Yarn is very similar to NPM, but its lockfile is called `yarn.lock` instead of NPM\'s `package-lock.json`. Like for NPM, Sigrid will prioritize the lockfile over `package.json` during its analysis.

You can generate this report from the command line, as part of your build pipeline:

    mvn dependency:tree > maven.tree

If Sigrid finds both POM files and the `maven.tree` file in your upload, the `maven.tree` file takes precedence.

Note that you need to run this command *before* you publish your code to Sigrid, otherwise the file will not end up in the upload. Also note that it is not necessary to commit this file to your repository, generating it on-the-fly in the pipeline is sufficient for Sigrid.

## Gradle

Unlike most other dependency management tools, Gradle does not use a configuration file format like XML or JSON or YAML. Instead, it uses a full-blown programming language (originally Groovy, but Kotlin build scripts are also supported in newer versions). Gradle build scripts are therefore incredibly flexible, but they are also much harder to analyze for tools like Sigrid.

If you use the configuration DSL to define your dependencies, Sigrid will automatically pick them up.

    dependencies {
        api "com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.8"
        testImplementation "org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.7.2"
    }

Defining dependencies in this way will work just fine. However, there are much more flexible ways.

===========================================================

The [Sigrid CI documentation](../sigridci-integration/development-workflows.md) contains instructions on how you can integrate Sigrid INTO rag.your development platform, which allows you to publish your code to Sigrid after every change. That section of the documentation contains instructions for common development platforms, for example GitHub or Azure DevOps.

This page contains some additional instructions on how you can best publish your system\'s open source libraries to Sigrid, so that they can be analyzed by Sigrid and shown in the [Open Source Health](system-open-source-health) page. The official, though somewhat obscure, term for this information is a [SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom).

First of all, it is not necessary to submit the *binaries* for every library. If your system uses a dependency management tool, it is usually sufficient to send the corresponding configuration files. For example, Maven uses `pom.xml` to list dependencies, Gradle uses `build.gradle`, and NPM uses `package.json`. If any of those files are included in your repository, they will be picked up automatically.

However, in some cases there might be extra options or caveats when using certain dependency management tools. The sections below contain some more specific instructions to take INTO rag.consideration when using one of those dependency management tools. Also refer to [supported dependency management tools and open source ecosystems](../reference/technology-support.md) for a complete list of all supported technologies.

## Maven

### Maven properties

Maven properties are supported. It is quite common to define library versions as Maven properties:

## How to set Objectives



## Comparing status and objectives in the System Overview page

When set, the status of a system against its goals is shown in the *System Overview* tab, as shown below.

<img src="../images/objectives-overview.png" width="750" />

Objectives show the evolution of the system quality over time. Thereby they are useful for [roles](../getting-started/roles.md) such as Enterprise Architects to see where technical debt is moving. It also has a signaling function to make explicit what goals teams should be working towards, and therefore, how the portfolio ought to be moving. This is, of course, only meaningful if these targets/thresholds have been agreed upon beforehand with teams/Product Owners/Development managers, etc.

## Understanding Objectives in detail: System Overview page

Objectives can be set as below on the *System Overview* page:

<img src="../images/objectives-system.png" width="600" />

There are six different columns which mean the following:

1. *Status* checkmark: The leftmost checkmark is a visual indicator that tells you whether the target for an objective is being met in the currently analyzed snapshot.
The green checkmark shows that the test code ratio is at least 80% and that the maintainability rating target is also being met.

INSERT INTO rag.text_segments (id, document_id, content, metadata, embedding) VALUES (669951194516026356, 669951194511831853, e'*Type* column: The *Type* indicates the type of the objective which is dependent on the capability. Examples of types of objectives include: Maintainability, Dependency Upgrade Period, Test Code Ratio, etc.
4. *Target* column: The *Target* is the desired measurable value of the objective. It is important to revisit this periodically, because targets will likely vary over time. A likely cause for a target change is the system\'s *Lifecycle*. Similarly, *Business criticality* typically also is a determinant.
5. *Delta* column: The delta can have several values: Achieved, Improved, Unchanged, Unknown and Worsened.
6. *Level* column: The level at which an objective is being applied: it can either be a specific system-level objective override, that only applies to a specific system (System in the table) or it can be a portfolio-level objective that applies to all systems in a portfolio.

### Detailed information about the Delta column

Objectives are measured for a specific code snapshot, which will typically fall within the selected period in the UI. The delta column attempts to present a comprehensive overview of the relationship between the delta and the state of an objective at the start and the end of the period.

## About Objectives

**Objectives** are targets that can be set in Sigrid, to compare against system status and quality trends. In this context, objectives are understood as being *non-functional requirements*. They are considered separate from metadata (see [metadata page](../organization-integration/metadata.md)), since *Objectives* do not describe characteristics of systems themselves, but where you want them to be.

Objectives can be set per different quality characteristics and levels of detail. Examples are: a range of desired *Maintainability*, desired *New code quality*, minimum *Test code ratio*, or the maximum number of *Medium risk vulnerabilities* in libraries (*Open Source Health*).

Our [Guidelines for using Objectives](../workflows/best-practices-objectives.md) provides more background on the thinking behind objectives and how to make them work in your organization. This section focusses on the action needed in Sigrid.

Two types of objectives exist:

**Portfolio Objective**:  A type of objective that targets a group of systems based on similar metadata, aiming to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience that removes the need to set objectives individually for each system and better prioritization. (General rule). Find out more in the section [how to define portofolio objectives](../capabilities/portfolio-objectives.md).

**System Objective**: A type of objective specific to an individual system within a portfolio that does not follow the general rule. When an objective is set at the system level, the system no longer follows the objective defined at the portfolio level.

In practice this is not always convenient, so if you\'re using Sigrid CI we recommend you stop using SFTP and just Sigrid CI for all uploading/publishing to Sigrid.

### I\'m receiving an error message about UnicodeEncodeError

In some environments, Sigrid CI can produce the following error:

    UnicodeEncodeError: \'charmap\' codec can\'t encode characters

This happens when Sigrid CI tried to provide command line output that includes UTF-8 characters, but `stdout` is unable to display such errors. This can be solved by adding the `export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8` environment variable.

### I\'m receiving an error message about dubious ownership in repository

This message occurs when the (Linux) user that cloned your Git repository is different from the (Linux) user that is running the CI job. This scenario is pretty uncommon, in the majority of cases the entire CI pipeline is performed with the same user. If you see this error, you can add `git config --global --add safe.directory <repository-dir>` to tell Git it is safe to trust the directory to which the repository was cloned. Note you need to provide the directory\'s absolute path, Git will not allow `.`.

==================================

### Sigrid Security

See [Sigrid Security: Frequently Asked Questions](faq-security.md).

### Sigrid Architecture Quality

See [Sigrid Architecture Quality: Frequently Asked Questions](faq-architecture.md).

## Usage questions

### Do you support pull request integration?

Yes! There are basically two usage scenarios for Sigrid CI, and you would typically use them both.

The first Sigrid CI use case is to *publish* your project\'s source code to Sigrid, which makes the analysis results accessible on [https://sigrid-says.com](https://sigrid-says.com). You would typically use this for your project\'s main branch, which can be `main`, `master`, or something project-specific. This is known as the *baseline version*.

The second use case is to use Sigrid CI for feedback during code reviews on pull requests. This wil compare the contents of the pull request agains the baseline version, allowing you to identify improvement areas in the new and changed code.

The [platform-specific documentation and examples](../README.md) cover instructions for both scenarios. We generally recommend to use Sigrid CI for both scenarios, although it\'s also perfectly fine to use Sigrid CI for one scenario but not the other.

### Does Sigrid CI fit in my workflow?

Different development teams use different workflows. Our [workflow documentation](../sigridci-integration/development-workflows.md) covers different development/branch/CI workflows, and how Sigrid CI would fit INTO rag.those workflows.

Moreover, we are constantly adding support for new technologies, and extending our support for existing ones. This even includes some pretty specific technologies with a focused group of target users, such as proprietary programming languages developed in-house at our clients.

If you are using a technology that you believe we do not support, please contact us using the contact information below, and we\'ll see what we can do.

### What is my system name?

You will find the system name in the url of the monitor in Sigrid. The structure is https://sigrid-says.com/customer/systemname/-/maintainability

### How to get a token and account?

Follow the instructions on how to create your personal token [here](../organization-integration/authentication-tokens.md)

### What target quality should we use?

Avoid setting an unreasonably high target quality level. While it seems appealing to be ambitious, this can be demotivating or frustrating to people, as it\'s not always possible to achieve such a high level in every single change.

For systems implemented in modern technologies, we recommend a target quality level of 3.5 stars. This strikes a balance between ambition and practicality. Note that 3.5 is already above the benchmark average of 3.0 stars, so this level is already asking developers to outperform the industry as a whole, and is therefore quite a high target.

INSERT INTO rag.text_segments (id, document_id, content, metadata, embedding) VALUES (669951194507637740, 669951194507637737, e'1 stars, it\'s not realistic to ask every single code change to rate 4.0 stars or higher. The same applies to systems in domains where the technology makes it harder to write maintainable code, for example when using low-level languages like C.

### Where can I find more information about your metrics?

Sigrid itself includes a brief explanation of all metrics in the "refactoring candidates" page. If you need more information, you can find the [Guidance for producers](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/SIG-TUViT-Evaluation-Criteria-Trusted-Product-Maintainability-Guidance-for-producers.pdf) on our website, which provides more details on what is measured and why.

For training purposes, SIG also published a book on [building maintainable software](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Maintainable-Software-Java-Future-Proof/dp/1491953527/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&qid=1610456817&refinements=p_27%3AJoost+Visser&s=books&sr=1-7&text=Joost+Visser), which contains detailed explanations on the metrics. It is not necessary to read the book to use Sigrid, but having training material available can be useful when training new or junior developers.

### How can I use Sigrid to improve my code maintainability?

Understanding on the used metrics is required [see the SIG quality model page](../reference/sig-quality-models.md). Because you will have a better idea of what the metrics are measuring conceptually, how it will help your maintenance, and what you should pay attention to. [The system maintainability page](system-maintainability.md) offers you an overview for navigating and understanding maintainability in Sigrid.

Depending on how you are using Sigrid (CI-integrated or web interface), you will see different levels of detail and follow a different order of activities (e.g. see the workflows:[general Agile process](../workflows/agile-development-process.md), [Architect](../workflows/architect.md), [Developer](../workflows/developer.md), [Product Owner](../workflows/product-owner.md) or [(Development) Manager](../workflows/manager.md)).

### What is the maximum upload size for Sigrid CI?

Sigrid CI is limited to uploads of 500 MB. This is mainly for performance reasons, since uploading and unpacking huge files takes some time, which endangers Sigrid CI\'s goal of providing quick feedback. Note that based on our experience 99% of repositories easily fit within this limit. Also, Sigrid will only measure the actual source code maintained by your development team. Other artifacts, such as libraries, binaries, or other non-source files are excluded.

### Can I exclude certain files from being uploaded?

For example, the following would be excluded automatically:

- The `node_modules` directory is excluded by default as it contains [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) libraries
- The `target` directory is excluded as it contains build output from [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

In addition to that, you can also exclude files and directories specifically for your project. This is done using the `--exclude` parameter, which is explained in the [configuration documentation](../sigridci-integration/integration.md) page.

### Do Sigrid CI uploads get added to the Sigrid dashboard?

No. This is intentional: Sigrid CI tends to operate on pull requests, which are often branches that are a work-in-progress and still need to be reviewed. Adding every single build to the Sigrid dashboard would create a lot of noise, which makes it harder to use the dashboard for spotting trends and reporting. This is why there are two separate streams of uploads: one used for Sigrid CI (based on branches/pull requests), and one used to feed the Sigrid dashboard (based on a relatively stable branch, such as main).

Of course, one size doesn\'t fit all. Post-beta versions of Sigrid CI will at least give the *option* to also publish uploads to the Sigrid dashboard, so that every team can decide for themselves which uploads should be visible in the dashboard and which should not.

This would typically be the main branch, though for some teams the baseline could also be based on a release branch, the development branch, or an improvement branch. The baseline therefore depends on the team\'s way of working and branching strategy.

### Why am I being penalized for problems that were already there?

We created Sigrid CI to be used during code reviews, so the feedback is based on only the files you touched during your pull request, not the whole system.

However, we do consider the *entire* contents of those files, not only the lines that you personally wrote. This is because of the [boy scout rule](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch08.html): *"Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it."*. Refactoring and regular work are not two separate activities, they belong together. Having separate tickets to refactor certain areas is OK, but it indicates that something went wrong earlier in the process, that led to those issues being introduced in the first place. Ideally, small refactorings should be done *during* regular tickets. That means that any tickets affecting existing files should not *only* consist of implementing the new behavior. You should also strive to make small refactorings that relate to the code you\'re currently working on. You have the files open anyway!

There are limits to the amount of refactoring you can do in the context of a single ticket. It\'s probably not a good idea to change the entire architecture while working on a bug fix. This is why Sigrid CI reports on a subset of [SIG\'s maintainability quality model](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/methodologies/iso-iec-25010-2011-standard/): the code-level metrics are in scope, but the architecture-level metrics are not. This is due to the difference in *local* versus *global* refactorings. Making some changes in the context of a file tend to be fairly local, in that they don\'t affect a lot of other people. This is why those types of refactoring are fine to work on during regular development work. In contrast, architectural refactoring will have a big impact on a lot of people, so this is something that needs more consideration and needs to be planned separately.

Let us know if you believe we *should* provide feedback on architecture metrics in Sigrid CI, as we are considering to offer it as an option in a future version.

### Should we fail the build if the Sigrid CI check fails?

That\'s obviously your decision and something that depends on your development process. However, if you\'re asking our advice, we would say a failing Sigrid CI check should produce a warning rather than an error. That might seem like ridiculous advice coming from a company that creates software quality tooling, but we can explain.

It\'s obviously possible to fix every single issue, but it\'s probably not worth it considering what you get in return. Sigrid focuses on a relatively limited set of metrics, to avoid overloading developers with tons of instructions. Moreover, a small amount of non-conformities is tolerated, as long as the overall quality doesn\'t drop below a certain level.

We therefore believe in a comply-or-explain model. Obviously, you should still strive to pass the Sigrid CI check in the overwhelming majority of cases. However, in the rare cases the check fails, it\'s perfectly OK for the reviewer to overrule the check and accept the pull request, as long as the reviewer finds that the author had good reasons for deviating from the best practice in that particular case.

### Why does deleted code not influence the rating?

In general, deleting code improves maintainability. The less code you have, the less you have to maintain. Having less code also makes it easier to make structural changes, since such changes will require less effort. So if you navigate in Sigrid, you may find its effects. The exact consequences depend on how "good or bad" the deleted code was compared to the rest of the codebase, since volume is the common denominator for the maintainability metrics ([See for more details the technical documentation](../reference/sig-quality-models.md)).

Also, the majority of pull requests are about adding new code or changing existing code, deleting code is less common, so we have chosen to not optimize for that scenario.

### We have a multi-repo project, can I still use Sigrid CI?

Yes. In some situations, the view of your project/system in Sigrid might differ from your repository structure. For example, you might have separate repositories for your back-end and front-end, yet Sigrid combines them INTO rag.one big system.

There are two ways to use Sigrid CI in such a situation.

- You can change the structure in Sigrid to match your repositories. This is the simplest option, but different roles
  can have different opinions on what is a suitable structure in Sigrid (though development teams tend to prefer Sigrid
  matching their repositories).
- Even when *not* changing the Sigrid structure, it is still possible to run Sigrid CI for your repository. You can use
  the `--subsystem` option to explain Sigrid CI how your repository structure should be matched to your Sigrid
  configuration. This option is explained in [using the Sigrid CI client script](../reference/client-script-usage.md).

## Why are there differences between the directory structure as we see it in our IDE and Sigrid components?

### Can I see which files are uploaded to Sigrid?

Yes. You can add the `--showupload` option when calling the [client script](../reference/client-script-usage.md). This will add log output for every file that is included in the upload that is submitted to Sigrid.

### Why do you have both publish and publishonly options, what is the difference?

The [list of Sigrid CI options](../reference/client-script-usage.md) lists two options with similar names and descriptions, `--publish` and `--publishonly`. These options support slightly different scenarios:

- `--publish` publishes your project\'s source code to Sigrid, *and* provides feedback on your changes within your Continuous Integration environment.
- `--publishonly` also publishes your code to Sigrid, but it *does not* provide feedback within the Continuous Integration environment.

So which one should you use? That depends on your development process. If you use pull requests, you can use `--publishonly`. In this scenario, you\'ve already received feedback for your pull request, so there is no need to receive the same feedback again when you merge your changes to your main/master branch. If you *do not* use pull requests, or if you are not sure, it is best to use `--publish` since it will give you the most feedback.

Sigrid CI requires Python 3.7 or higher.
In some cases multiple python versions are installed in the environment and the wrong one (below 3.7) may be selected automatically. If that is the case, please make sure that the highest version is set to be the default.
When not using Docker to run the script, this requires that the dependencies in the environment in which the script is being ran are in sync with the actual code, and, in order to do that, you can run either `pip install -r requirement.txt` or `pipenv install`, when using Python virtual environments.

### I\'m receiving an error message that certificate verification failed

In some cases, the Sigrid CI client script might produce an error message `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate`. This indicates that Python is unable to access the system\'s certificate store. Sigrid CI does not need any special or custom certificates, access to the regular system certificates is sufficient.

If your environment requires a certificate store in a custom location, the environment variables `openssl_cafile_env` and `openssl_capath_envz` can be used to point Python to the correct location. Refer to the [Python documentation on OpenSSL](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html) for more information

### I used the subsystem option and see results from other subsystems

To give you feedback on your changes Sigrid CI uses both the source code and measurement results from the last published
measurement. If new results are published while we retrieve these measurements, some discrepancies might occur. If this
happens, try running Sigrid CI again, preferably at a quieter moment. If it is a recurring issue,
please [contact us](mailto:support@softwareimprovementgroup.com).

### Where do I find the Sigrid CI output ?

The results of the SigridCI run are logged in the terminal output and optional as a html artefact. For the artefact to be stored you will need to specify the Sigrid CI output path in your yml. Check out the examples for GitHub and GitLab.

### I started using Sigrid CI, and now I suddenly see more code in Sigrid

Sigrid supports multiple ways to upload source code. This documentation covers Sigrid CI, but we also support uploads via SFTP. If you previously used SFTP and then switch to Sigrid CI, you might see some differences. For example, you might suddenly see extra code, or extra components. This is caused by differences in how the upload is created. Unfortunately that means there is no "quick fix" outside of updating your configuration.

### Where is your service hosted?

Sigrid, including Sigrid CI, is hosted on Amazon Web Services. If you have specific questions on our infrastructure, please [contact us](mailto:support@softwareimprovementgroup.com).

### Do we need to update our firewall settings?

Possibly. As mentioned above, Sigrid is hosted on AWS. This means your firewall needs to allow outgoing traffic in order to submit your project\'s source code to Sigrid. In practical terms this means the following:

- Allow outbound traffic to `sigrid-says.com` on port 443
- Allow outbound traffic to `auth.sigrid-says.com` on port 443
- Allow outbound traffic to `sig-sigrid-ci-upload.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` on port 443

[Contact SIG](mailto:support@softwareimprovementgroup.com) if you need specific information on this setup.

### Do you support people using their own certificates or certificate authority?

Yes, but you will need to explicitly tell Python to trust your certificates.

- First, make sure your certificate `pem` files are accessible from where you are running Sigrid CI.
  - If you are running Sigrid CI from your own environment, simply make sure the location is accessible from your pipeline.
    - In this scenario, Python will automatically pick up certificates from your operating system\'s certificate store, meaning you should not need manual configuration.

### We have a lot of (new) security findings. What should we do first?
Please see [elaboration on such strategies in the system-level security page](system-security.md#a-general-typical-strategy-for-processing-security-findings), or [specifically the paragraph on filtering security findings](system-security.md#filtering-results-for-false-positives-starting-with-open-source-vulnerabilities).

### To what extent does SIG provide consultancy for security findings?

This depends on your agreement with SIG, which can differ per system:

- **Fully automated findings:** You will always receive frequent new findings from the scan tools built INTO rag.Sigrid. Much expertise of SIG is constantly going INTO rag.the selection and configuration of these tools and the rules they apply. This includes the smart software that provides as much useful information about the finding, including links to various resources with more information.
- **Manual refinement:** This service provides interpretation, selection and enrichment of  tool findings by SIG experts. SIG experts remove false positives as much as possible. Where necessary, risk levels are changed. In addition, the SIG experts add remarks to the findings, with interpretation details and when relevant some mediation advice.
  - How far does SIG advisory go when it comes to findings refinement?

Open Source Health offers the option to create an SBOM (Software Bill Of Materials) report, either through the Sigrid user interface or [through the Sigrid API](../integrations/sigrid-api-documentation.md#vulnerable-libraries-in-open-source-health).

### Does SIG filter when resolving our system\'s dependencies?

SIG can filter dependency checks for internal dependencies to avoid exposing internal names, but they must be configured manually by SIG. [See the Open Source Health paragraph in our scope configuration document](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#open-source-health). Please inform SIG of such dependencies and their name conventions before onboarding.

### Why are some Open Source vulnerabilities missing a CVE?

SIG gathers data from multiple ecosystems. Most of these ecosystems link library vulnerabilities to CVEs, but some provide their own data that is not connected to CVEs.

### What are the risk thresholds that determine low-medium-high risk?

They are shown as a mouseover on the Open Source Health page in the top tile that summarizes risks. See the [open-source health page](system-open-source-health.md#navigating-the-overview-page).

See the [explanation on CVSS in the security page](system-security.md#context-and-meaning-of-cvss-security-metrics-from-asset-to-risk) and [its different levels in Sigrid](system-security.md#cvss-scores-in-sigrid).

## Open Source Health

### Does Sigrid support transitive dependencies?
Yes. This is configurable. Scanning transitive dependencies is preferable from a security perspective, as vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies may be equally problematic as vulnerabilities in direct dependencies. However, it does introduce nuances: transitive dependencies might not actually be callable because they are somehow inactive. As a steering mechanism it may seem unfair to some teams, since the transitive dependencies are not within their direct control.

Therefore, scanning transitive dependencies can be enabled or disabled in [the analysis configuration](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#open-source-health).

### Why does the finding list count certain findings twice?

The findings list indicates *compliance*. Sometimes a single finding on a vulnerable library has multiple vulnerabilities in multiple categories (e.g. injection and XXE). In that case these are counted separately in the list. However, despite the finding appearing in multiple categories, it is still the same finding. It only counts as a single finding towards the total, and resolving the finding will resolve it towards all categories.

### What technology is Open Source Health based on?

===========================================

This FAQ specifically covers Sigrid\'s security functionality. Also check the [Sigrid FAQ](faq.md) for more information about Sigrid in general.

## Security findings (ex. Open Source Health)

### Is it possible that Sigrid creates new findings without us changing the code?

Yes, in some cases. We are continuously extending our security knowledge base. Therefore, new findings are sometimes discovered in existing code. It might seem as a deterioration of the system\'s security. But actually it is a more accurate assessment of *security risk* in the system.

### What statuses can security findings have?
See [Different statuses of security findings](system-security.md#different-statuses-of-security-findings).

### How does the automatic detection of "Fixed" findings work?
The status of a finding is automatically updated based on its "fingerprint". If a fingerprint is no longer found, the issue will be set to *Fixed*. If a new fingerprint is found, it will become a new finding.

The finding fingerprint is a calculated identifier based on multiple characteristics of the finding: analysis tool, rule, file name, and the line of code where the finding was located combined with the line before and after it.

We use this approach to reduce the amount of busywork. Findings are automatically resolved to avoid situations where people fix something in the code, but then forget to update the finding in Sigrid. Moreover, multiple overlapping findings will automatically be merged if they have the same fingerprint. This means automatic deduplication, which is important for keeping the findings as actionable as possible.

But it\'s also possible to *manually* export your repository history and publish it to Sigrid, as explained [here](../organization-integration/upload-instructions.md#creating-a-zip-file-for-your-system). If you run INTO rag.a situation where you believe you correctly published your repository to Sigrid, yet you\'re not seeing the results in Sigrid, you can use the steps below to assist you in troubleshooting the issue:

- Make sure you are pushing a `git.log` file to Sigrid. This file contains your repository history, and should be located in the same directory as the source code for that repository.
- Open the file and count the commits. Every commit uses a `@@@` prefix to make this easier to count. If you are only exporting a single commit, you might have accidentally published a [shallow clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone). A shallow clone does not include the Git history.
- Open the file and make sure it uses the UTF-8 character encoding.
- Check the dates for each commit, which you can check in the lines with the `@@@` prefix. By default, Sigrid will only analyze commits from the last year, so any commits older than that will be ignored. You can change [the history period used by Sigrid in the configuration](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#analyzing-your-repository-history), in case you want to use a longer period.

### Are Git submodules supported?

Yes. This does require you to initialize the submodules as part of your build pipeline, but this is done automatically by basically all mainstream development platforms. If you are manually cloning your repository in your pipeline, use `git clone --recurse-submodules` to clone both the "main" repository as well as its submodules.

### How does the change history analysis process merge commits versus squashing commits?

Teams working with Git will often use slightly different workflows:
[merge commits or squashing commits](https://blog.mergify.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-merge-commit-a-squash/).
We support both as part of our analysis. When using merge commits, we only count the "original commit" and not the
merge commit itself, to avoid counting every change twice. When squashing commits, we analyze the squashed commit
instead of the original commits, for the practical reason that we no longer have access to the original commits after
they have been squashed.

### Do we support shallow clones?

No, as the shallow clone will only download the code and will *not* download the change history.

### Can I exclude my repository from the upload to Sigrid altogether?

Yes. Sigrid CI generates a log file called `git.log`, and you can exclude this file from being uploaded. You can use the `--exclude` [option in Sigrid CI](../reference/client-script-usage.md), for example `--exclude git.log`.

================================================

This FAQ specifically covers Sigrid\'s Architecture Quality functionality. Also check the [Sigrid FAQ](faq.md) for more information about Sigrid in general.

### How do I enable Architecture Quality for my project?

Architecture Quality is available by default. Once you\'ve published your system, you will automatically see an "Architecture" tab appear when you view your system in Sigrid.

You can us the [scope documentation](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md) to customize the Architecture Quality analysis for this system, if necessary.

### How do I enable the change history analysis?

This will happen automatically, assuming that you enabled Architecture Quality in the scope file and the change history is available.

### Which version control systems does SIG support for analyzing the change history?

Git, which has over 95 percent market share. Supporting other version control systems would require an unreasonable
amount of effort for the SIG infrastructure. However, clients can convert their repository to Git during their
pipeline. Examples:

  - [Subversion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/perform-migration-from-svn-to-git?view=azure-devops)
  - [Mercurial](https://markheath.net/post/how-to-convert-mercurial-repository-to)
  - [Microsoft TFS](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs)

### Does Architecture Quality support self-service configuration?

Yes, and the options are explained in the [scope documentation](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md).

### Do we support change history analysis for multi-repo systems?

This page provides you with a summary, but you may decide that further investigation INTO rag.your system\'s current architecture is needed. You can use the "explore architecture" button to navigate to Sigrid\'s architecture explorer page. Clicking on one of the system properties on the right will *also* take you to the architecture explorer page, but will then immediately jump to the system property you just clicked on.

## Exploring your system\'s as-is architecture

The architecture explorer page visualizes your architecture. Not the architecture that was initially planned, not the to-be architecture, but the implemented as-is architecture. The information used to provide this view is extracted from your source code, your repository history, and your configuration.

In this visualization, every "block" is a *system element* in your code. Depending on the terminology you use, this could be called a subsystem or a component.

Having the ability to save specific configurations of the canvas will allow teams to quickly access the dependencies between components or sub-components of highest interest and share these views across team members to get a more consistent perspective of your system\'s architecture at any level you deem important.

Accessing saved views is easily done through the architecture explorer, where we\'ve introduced a simple button that toggles a new panel to appear with an inventory of any saved views that exist for a given system.

<img src="../images/aq-saved-views-button.png" width="500" />

In order to create a new saved view, you must first open the "Open Saved Views Panel" button on the right side of the canvas explorer, which expands the Saved Views Panel over the existing Details Panel. From here, users can select from one of the existing saved views to render within the explorer canvas, or click the "Save current view" button at the top to save the current architecture configuration rendered in the explorer.

<img src="../images/aq-saved-views-panel.png" width="300" />

When clicking on the "Save current view" button, you will be prompted to give a name to the configuration currently displayed in the architecture canvas, so picking a descriptive name other than the default is highly recommended.

### Highlighting undesirable dependencies

You might have noticed that some dependencies are shown in red. These dependencies are considered undesirable, either because they violate a known architectural anti-pattern (for example cyclic dependencies), or because they have been marked as undesirable in [your configuration](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#architecture-quality).

<img src="../images/architecture-undesirable-dependency.png" width="350" />

### Grouping and annotating components

In some cases, you might want to communicate additional information through Sigrid\'s architecture view. Such information does not directly originate from the source code, but adds some context that makes the architecture easier to find and interpret.

You can define *groups* and *annotations* in [your configuration](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#architecture-quality). This information will then be depicted as an overlay on top of the architecture visualization in Sigrid.

### Saving architectural views

As such, you will often want to target a specific set of components that have relations between each other while removing other components from view to more easily identify and triage these riskful hotspots without having to navigate through a mess of component and dependencies that are "muddying the waters" of your analysis.

Sigrid assists with this localized traige by allowing you to hide components (and their related dependencies) as needed. Alternatively, you can also "pin" components within the visualization to ensure they remain in view whenever you\'re navigating the architecture. Using these controls together allows you to keep systems elements that have your interest in sight, while hiding away those that are not relevant.

Hiding and/or pinning of components can be done in multiple ways:

1. When hovering over a component in the architecture canvas, two togglable icons will appear in the bottom left of the component\'s box:
- A Pin icon which ensures the component remains in view regardles of other actions in the canvas.
- A Hide icon to force the component out of view until it is reshown.

You can use the "folder" icon in the top left of the page to open the tree view. This provides you with a secondary way of navigating your architecture. Using the tree view is quicker in some scenarios, for example if you want to quickly check what files are located within a certain component. The tree view and the main architecture visualization are linked, so selecting a subcomponent in the tree view will also navigate to that same subcomponent in the architecture visualization.

<img src="../images/aq-tree.png" width="250" />

The tree view also includes a search option. You can use this to locate a specific system element within your architecture, such as a component, file, end point, or database. This is also linked to the main architecture visualization, so clicking on the search results will also navigate the main architecture visualization to that same system element.

<img src="../images/aq-search.png" width="250" />

Finally, the buttons around the page allow you to manipulate the architecture view:

<img src="../images/aq-display-options.png" width="400" />

- The settings icon allows you to customize what is displayed, as depicted above.
- The "reset layout" button resets the architecture visualization to its original state, which can help to restore readability.
- The zoom buttons are an alternative way to zoom the architecture visualization, in addition to using your trackpad or mouse wheel to zoom.

You can use the "show legend" button in the top left to get more information on what each element in the visualization means.

Each system element also includes a magnifying glass icon. Clicking this icon will "expand" the system element, which allows you to see its internal architecture. In many cases this low-level architecture is more actionable, as this is usually the responsibility of the team working on that system element. In other words: you need many people to discuss changes to your top-level architecture, but you can usually address issues in your internal architecture with your own team.

The different tabs across the top of the page represent the system properties in SIG\'s Architecture Quality Model. Selecting a different tab will also change the architecture view, to provide more specific information relevant to that system property. It will also change the detail panel on the right, to expose more detailed charts and data relevant to the selected system property.

For example the spread of code contributions over developers. We then compare your results against [SIG\'s benchmark](../getting-started/approach.md) to clarify what is going well and where improvement is needed.

The overview page provides a summary of your system\'s current architecture, relative to the other systems in SIG\'s benchmark. The structure of this page is comparable to Sigrid\'s [maintainability summary](system-maintainability.md): you have an overall rating, which is then split INTO rag.a number of underlying system properties and associated ratings.

High quality application development requires software architecture. On paper, it describes your technical choices, constraints, and is a reflection of business decisions. But the architecture may look very different once it is implemented in code. Objectively, badly implemented architecture is easy to see (like incoherence). To assess what is well-implemented architecture, we have to look broader.

Software architecture can seem abstract, but it is ultimately how the structure of your software facilitates the people working on it. The code will not care that it is highly coupled, but the people working on that code certainly do care about having dependencies on other people and teams. Sigrid can help you to both *communicate* the as-is architecture as it is actually implemented, and also help to find opportunities on how it can be improved.

## A wide measure of Architecture Quality

When people talk about "legacy" or "monoliths", they often mean much more than just outdated technology. What people usually mean is software that has become too fragile for changes to be timely, predictable, and reliable. Usually due to poor architecture or team knowledge loss. An architecture should be able to adapt to those changing circumstances. Therefore, we define *architecture quality* as the degree to which an architecture is flexible and adaptable to change.

Sigrid visualizes your software landscape according to various technical quality aspects, INTO rag.a single solution. *Quality* here is understood as characteristics of technical health (or technical debt). This includes terms defined and understood in the ISO 25010 standard, such as maintainability and security. Bringing these aspects together broadens your overview of your software landscape, which helps you expose possible technical risks.

<img src="images/objectives-overview.png" width="600" />

The screenshot above shows an example on how Sigrid can help you to define and track objectives for various quality aspects. You can do this for every system in your portfolio. For more context on the relation between systems and their repositories, see [systems](organization-integration/systems.md).

## How does Sigrid work?

Essentially, Sigrid’s insights are based on source code analysis. Analyses are run on the code "as is", so without actually running the system. This is known as *static analysis*, as opposed to *dynamic analysis*. Dynamic analysis of software is more typically done by the developers themselves, because it requires a simulation of how a system will behave in operation.

Sigrid recognizes, calculates and prioritizes code characteristics that indicate software health. Such as whether the code contains design anti-patterns (undesirable constructs), whether the code contains security flaws (or imported, external code contains those).

Sigrid is a fact-supported cost-saver, risk-management aid and a technical-debt prioritization tool that can be used to improve quality at all system levels.

It does that by providing you the data to steer business decisions and make technical improvements.

## Sigrid, how we see it

We know that most organizations rely on software to run their business. Software, and taking control of it, is therefore at the center of business decisions.

- To make confident business decisions in this context, you need to be confident about the internals (the health) of your software landscape. We will provide you with the data to get that insight, and make informed decisions. The type of data accommodates the organizational context. Therefore, functionality focuses on:
  - Seeing trends of the portfolio of software as a whole.
  - Bringing together many types of technical health (such as maintainability, security, architecture).
  - Offering transparency on IT quality, which evokes accountability and makes code contributors proud of their work.

## What can you use Sigrid for?

As SIG’s software quality assurance platform, Sigrid provides a *single source of truth* of software health. This helps you steer decision-making while you buy, build, maintain and modernize your software. We call this ‘bit to boardroom insights’.
